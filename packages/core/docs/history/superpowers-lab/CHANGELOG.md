## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-01

### Removed

- **slack-messaging** skill: removed. It used the browser-token `slackcli` approach, now superseded by the dedicated `slackline` plugin and its `using-slack` skill (a real bot identity instead of browser tokens). The standalone skill competed for the same triggers and pointed at the deprecated path.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **windows-vm** skill: Create, manage, and connect to a headless Windows 11 VM running in Docker with KVM acceleration and SSH access. Supports full lifecycle management (create, start, stop, restart, ssh, status) with automated OpenSSH, Node.js, and Claude Code setup.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-31

### Added

- **slack-messaging** skill: Send and read Slack messages from the command line using slackcli. Supports multiple workspaces with browser token authentication. Includes helper script for token extraction.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added

- **finding-duplicate-functions** skill: Detect semantic code duplication in LLM-generated codebases using a two-phase approach (classical extraction + LLM-powered intent clustering). Includes shell scripts for function extraction, category splitting, and report generation.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-11-10

### Added

- Initial release with experimental skills
- **using-tmux-for-interactive-commands** skill: Control interactive CLI tools through tmux sessions
- **mcp-cli** skill: On-demand MCP server usage via the mcp CLI tool
