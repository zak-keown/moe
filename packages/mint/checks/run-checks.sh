#!/usr/bin/env bash
# checks/run-checks.sh — container-backed offline install checks for a
# generated moe-mint plugin.
#
# Ships with the moe-mint npm package (see package.json "files") and is
# bind-mounted read-only at /checks by `moe-mint test`
# (src/test-command.ts), which also mounts the generated plugin read-only at
# /plugin and sets MOE_MINT_PLUGIN_NAME to the plugin's name from
# moe-mint.yaml. Runs in two tiers, both fully offline — never invokes an
# LLM, needs no API keys or network access:
#   1. Shallow checks: each harness's cheapest "does this actually
#      load/parse" check against the mounted plugin (manifests parse,
#      referenced paths exist).
#   2. Deep install-verification checks (install-<harness>): a REAL install of
#      the plugin into each harness CLI present, then an assertion that the CLI
#      actually enumerates the plugin's skills. See the deep tier below.
#
# Set MOE_MINT_PLUGIN_ROOT to point at a different plugin root (default: /plugin).
# This is only for local development — it lets this script be unit-tested
# directly against a generated fixture without a container; the real
# `moe-mint test` invocation always mounts at /plugin and relies on the
# default.
#
# Output is TAP-ish: one line per check (deep-tier lines are named
# install-<harness>) —
#   ok <name>: <what passed>
#   not ok <name>: <what failed>
#   skip <name>: <why it was skipped (not generated, CLI unavailable)>
# Exit status: 0 if no "not ok" line was printed, else 3 — a distinctive
# code chosen so it can't collide with docker's own generic exit 1 (e.g.
# daemon down, no socket perms), which src/test-command.ts must tell apart
# from a real check failure.

# ============================================================================
# Deep install-verification tier
# ============================================================================
# Everything above proves the generated manifests parse and their referenced
# paths exist. This tier goes a level deeper: it performs a REAL install of
# the plugin into each harness CLI that is present, then asserts the CLI
# actually ENUMERATES the plugin's skills — the question that catches a
# manifest that is valid but wired to the wrong place.
#
# These installs mutate only $HOME (marketplaces, caches, settings), never the
# mounted plugin dir: each installer runs against a writable COPY of the
# plugin, and several of them (codex, droid, hermes) install by CLONING it, so
# the copy is made a throwaway git repo. `moe-mint test` always runs this
# inside the container, whose $HOME is discarded per run. A check whose CLI is
# absent from PATH emits `skip`, never `not ok`, so the script stays runnable
# on a dev host outside the container (which is how the unit tests exercise it).

# claude-code and copilot install THROUGH the emitted .claude-plugin
# descriptor; deep_checks() rewrites its entry source to the local "./" form
# in the throwaway $WORK copy (rewrite_market_source_local, above) before
# these run, so a repository/http-sourced descriptor installs offline instead
# of needing a network clone. deep_claude_code/deep_copilot skip (never fail)
# only when that rewrite itself failed — MARKET_REWRITE_OK is 0 only for a
# malformed marketplace.json, which still deserves a report rather than a
# silent pass. Other harnesses install through their own descriptors (codex:
# .agents/plugins/marketplace.json, always local) or a direct path, so
