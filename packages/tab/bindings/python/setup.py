# The package is pure-Python ctypes but carries a platform-specific prebuilt dylib, so the
# wheel must be impure + platform-tagged, yet abi-agnostic (py3-none-<plat>). BinaryDistribution
# (has_ext_modules -> True) keeps the files at the wheel root; get_tag forces py3/none and takes
# the platform from MOE_TAB_WHEEL_PLAT so each CI leg stamps its exact arch.
