/**
 * `serve()` is a thin cross-runtime wrapper (Bun.serve / @hono/node-server).
 * It does NOT parse bodies, enforce size limits, or implement per-route
 * validation — those are caller concerns and the route handlers in src/api/
 * already have coverage for their 4xx/413 contracts in test/api/.
 *
 * The audit (item #6) called out "malformed JSON", "oversized payload",
 * and "mid-flight closed connections" as gaps. The first two don't belong
 * to serve.ts at all; the third does. This file pins the third.
 *
 * One other regression risk we considered: "fetch handler throws → server
 * keeps serving". We cannot pin that one in bun:test — Bun's unhandled-
 * error capture treats a server-side handler throw as a test failure
 * even when the underlying server is fine, so the test can't observe
 * the contract. In production, a route handler that throws is already
 * an evidence-bearing event (it shows up in normal `bun test` output);
 * a dedicated test here would be ceremonial.
