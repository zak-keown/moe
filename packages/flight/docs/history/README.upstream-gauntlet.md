# Gauntlet

Gauntlet is an AI-powered QA testing framework. It uses large language models (Claude or GPT) to test software the way a human tester would: working through web apps in a real browser, CLI tools at a stdin/stdout prompt, and terminal/TUI programs in a live tmux session — clicking, typing, reading screens, and reporting bugs. You write **story cards** -- markdown files with a title, description, and acceptance criteria -- and Gauntlet's AI agent works through them via one of three adapters (`web`, `cli`, `tui`), delivering a verdict (pass/fail/investigate) with evidence.

## What it does

1. **You describe what to test** in a story card -- a markdown file with a title, description, and acceptance criteria.
2. **An AI agent drives your target** through one of three adapters: a real Chrome browser (via CDP) for web apps, a stdin/stdout subprocess for CLI tools, or a tmux-hosted session for terminal/TUI programs.
3. **The agent explores and evaluates** your acceptance criteria, but also reports anything else it notices: bugs, UX issues, typos, accessibility problems, performance issues, and suggestions.
4. **You get a structured result** with a verdict, reasoning, observations, screenshots, and an action log.

Beyond single-story testing, Gauntlet can **generate variations** ("fanout") from a parent story card -- producing edge-case, error-path, and alternate-persona stories automatically. It can also generate follow-up stories from observations or failures in previous runs.

### Tech stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) (TypeScript)
- **Server**: [Hono](https://hono.dev) (minimal web framework)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Router 7 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Automation surfaces**: Chrome DevTools Protocol for `web` (custom CDP library), stdin/stdout subprocess for `cli`, tmux send-keys + ANSI capture-pane for `tui`
- **AI providers**: Anthropic SDK (Claude) and OpenAI SDK
- **Deployment**: Docker (Debian + Chromium + Bun); a separate `Dockerfile.chrome` ships a Google Chrome sidecar for amd64 production use
- **Storage**: File-based (no database) -- markdown for stories, JSON for results

## How it works

### Story cards

Story cards are markdown files (conventionally named `story.md`) with YAML-style frontmatter followed by a markdown body:

```markdown
---
id: login-001
title: User can log in with valid credentials
status: ready
tags: auth, smoke
stakeholder: end-user
---

Test the login flow for a registered user.

## Acceptance Criteria

- User can enter email and password
- Clicking "Log in" with valid credentials navigates to the dashboard
- Error message is shown for an incorrect password
```

**Frontmatter** (delimited by `---` lines, one `key: value` per line):

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | yes | Stable identifier for the card (used in URLs and filenames) |
| `title` | yes | One-line human-readable summary |
| `status` | no | `draft` or `ready` (defaults to `draft`). Only `ready` cards are surfaced for routine runs |
| `tags` | no | Comma-separated list (e.g. `auth, smoke`) |
| `stakeholder` | no | Whose perspective the test takes (e.g. `end-user`, `admin`) |
| `parent` | no | `id` of the parent card -- set automatically on fanout-generated variations to link back to the source. Lineage only; it does **not** imply run order or a dependency between cards. |

The frontmatter parser is intentionally minimal: it splits on the first `:` per line, so values are plain strings -- do not quote them and do not use nested YAML structures.

**Body**: free-form markdown describing the story. Everything before the `## Acceptance Criteria` heading is treated as the description and passed to the agent as context. Lines under `## Acceptance Criteria` that begin with `- ` are parsed as individual criteria; a criterion may soft-wrap across multiple lines -- continuation lines (indented or not) are joined onto the bullet until a blank line or the next bullet. The agent evaluates each one and the verdict reflects whether they all hold. The `## Acceptance Criteria` section is optional -- a description-only card is valid.

You can validate a card's format with `gauntlet validate story.md`.

Each file holds exactly one card: one frontmatter block, one description, one optional `## Acceptance Criteria` list. `gauntlet run` executes one card in one agent loop; `gauntlet batch` (see [Batch mode](#batch-mode) below) takes a set of card paths and runs them serially with a live progress display and an aggregate exit code.

**Copy-paste template** -- a minimal card you can drop into a new `story.md` and edit:

```markdown
---
id: my-card-001
title: Short description of what this tests
status: draft
tags: smoke
stakeholder: end-user
---

Describe the story here: what the tester should do, any setup or context
they need, and what a successful run looks like.

## Acceptance Criteria

- First thing that must be true
- Second thing that must be true
- Third thing that must be true
```

### Context

Cards describe outcomes. To get from *"Matt writes a journal entry"* to a real authenticated user clicking real buttons, the agent needs material the card itself doesn't carry: who Matt is, what his credentials are, how to get past the sign-in screen. That material lives in a folder at `.gauntlet/context/` — natural-language fixtures the agent reads as part of its system prompt.

A typical layout:

```
.gauntlet/context/
  HOW-TO-LOGIN.md         # plain English: where the sign-in form is, what to type
  profiles/
    matt/
      profile.md          # name, credentials, a sentence of personality
      cookies.yaml        # optional: pre-baked session for install_cookies
```

Filenames are not load-bearing. `HOW-TO-LOGIN.md`, `LOGIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md`, or `auth.md` all work — the agent infers what each file is for from its name and contents the same way a new teammate would skim a wiki. The card refers to the user by name in prose (*"Matt writes a post…"*); the agent picks the right profile by inference.

What context buys you: every card doesn't have to repeat itself. Add a profile once, and any card that mentions that user can sign in as them. Change a password in `profile.md`, and the next run picks it up — no test plumbing to update. When a card fails for an avoidable reason, the fix is usually a sentence in a `.md` file, not a code change.

For the auth specifics — `install_cookies`, password-based sign-in, the cookie-lifecycle quirk — see [`docs/credentials.md`](docs/credentials.md).

### The agent loop

The core of Gauntlet is an agentic loop in `src/agent/agent.ts`:

1. The story card is loaded and a system prompt is built, instructing the LLM to act as a thorough QA tester.
2. The LLM is given adapter tools — the set depends on which adapter the run picked. Web exposes a browser surface (mouse, keyboard, navigation, extraction, tab management); `cli` exposes `type` / `press` / `read_output`; `tui` exposes `type` / `press` / `read_screen`. See [Adapters](#adapters) for the full lists. A special `report_result` tool is always added.
3. On each turn, the LLM decides what to do -- take a screenshot, click a button, type into a form, etc. Tool results (including screenshot images) are fed back into the conversation.
4. The loop continues until the agent calls `report_result` with its verdict, or exhausts its wall-clock time budget (`--max-time`, default 5m). When the budget runs out, the orchestrator gives the agent one grace turn to file a final report before terminating.
5. Each tool call has a 30-second timeout to prevent hangs.

The agent reports:
- **Status**: `pass`, `fail`, or `investigate`
- **Summary and reasoning**: what happened and why
- **Observations**: an array of `{kind, description}` where kind is one of: `bug`, `ux`, `typo`, `suggestion`, `a11y`, `performance`

### Adapters

Gauntlet ships three adapters. The agent loop is identical at every level — only the tools and the "vision" the agent gets back change. Pick one with `--adapter web|cli|tui`. The default is `web`. For a six-story walkthrough that exercises all three, see [`docs/tutorial.md`](docs/tutorial.md).

| Adapter | What it drives | What `--target` is | Vision |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|--------|
| `web` | Real Chrome, via CDP | A URL | DOM text + pixel screenshots |
| `cli` | A subprocess spawned with `sh -c "<target>"` | A shell command | Bytes on stdout/stderr |
| `tui` | A target spawned inside a detached tmux session at 120×40 | A shell command | ANSI-rendered screen (colors, cursor, escapes preserved) |

#### Web adapter

`src/adapters/web/adapter.ts` drives Chrome via CDP. It exposes seventeen browser tools by default, plus three optional tools (`read`, `install_cookies`, `install_passkey`) that are mounted when the corresponding context files exist:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `screenshot` | Capture the page or a specific element (returns image to the LLM) |
| `click` | Click an element by selector (CSS, XPath, or `:contains('text')`) |
| `type` | Type text into an element |
| `press` | Press a special key (Enter, Tab, Escape, etc.) |
| `hover` | Move the mouse over an element (fires `:hover` and tooltips) |
| `double_click` | Double-click an element |
| `right_click` | Right-click to open a context menu |
| `drag` | Drag an element to another selector or to `{x, y}` coordinates |
| `mouse_move` | Move the mouse to viewport coordinates |
| `scroll` | Scroll the page or an element using real wheel events |
| `file_upload` | Upload local files into an `<input type=file>` |
| `navigate` | Go to a URL |
| `extract` | Return the page (or element) as DOM text |
| `eval` | Run a JavaScript expression in the page |
| `wait_for` | Wait for an element or text to appear |
| `new_tab` | Open a foreground tab for a side trip (OTP fetch, 2FA portal) |
| `close_tab` | Close the current side-trip tab and return to the original |
| `read` *(opt-in)* | Read a fixture file from `.gauntlet/context/` |
| `install_cookies` *(opt-in)* | Install browser cookies from `cookies.yaml` — see [`docs/credentials.md`](docs/credentials.md) |
| `install_passkey` *(opt-in)* | Register a virtual WebAuthn credential from `passkey.yaml` — see [`docs/credentials.md`](docs/credentials.md) |

Most tools support `return_screenshot` to automatically capture the page state after the action.

#### CLI adapter

`src/adapters/cli/adapter.ts` spawns the target with `sh -c "<target>"` and connects the agent to its stdin/stdout/stderr. No browser, no terminal emulator — the agent reads bytes and writes bytes.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `type` | Write text to the subprocess's stdin |
| `press` | Send a special key (Enter → `\n`, Tab → `\t`, Escape → `\x1b`, Ctrl+C/D/Z) |
| `read_output` | Read whatever the subprocess has written to stdout/stderr since the last read |
| `read` *(opt-in)* | Read a fixture file from `.gauntlet/context/` |

Use this for `npm init`-style prompt-and-answer flows, REPLs, and any program whose UI is a stream of plain text.

#### TUI adapter

`src/adapters/tui/adapter.ts` runs the target inside a detached `tmux` session at 120×40. Keystrokes go in via `tmux send-keys`; the screen comes back via `tmux capture-pane -p -e` with ANSI escapes preserved, so the agent reads color, cursor position, and inverse video the way a human would. Requires `tmux` on the host.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `type` | Send literal text to the tmux session |
| `press` | Send a named key (`Enter`, `Tab`, `Escape`, arrow keys, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Home`/`End`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Ctrl+C/D/Z/X/O/S/W/K/G`) |
| `read_screen` | Capture the current pane as ANSI-escaped text |
| `read` *(opt-in)* | Read a fixture file from `.gauntlet/context/` |

Use this for full-screen terminal UIs: `vim`, arrow-key selectors (`bun init`), `htop`, anything that uses cursor positioning or color as a UI signal.

### LLM providers

Gauntlet supports two providers via a common `LLMClient` interface:

- **Anthropic** (`src/models/anthropic.ts`): Uses Claude with prompt caching (ephemeral markers on system prompt, tools, and the last message) to reduce token costs on long agent runs.
- **OpenAI** (`src/models/openai.ts`): Standard chat completions API.

### Fanout: test variation generation

The fanout system (`src/fanout/generator.ts`) uses an LLM to automatically generate additional story cards from a parent card. Three modes:

- **Variations**: Edge cases, error paths, alternate personas, boundary conditions (3-5 generated per parent card).
- **From observations**: Promotes observations from a test run (bugs, UX issues, etc.) into focused follow-up story cards.
- **From failures**: When a test fails, generates 2-3 root-cause investigation stories.

Generated cards include `parent` linking back to the source and are validated against the story card format before being saved.

### Evidence collection

During each run, the `EvidenceLogger` captures:
- **Screenshots**: PNG images saved to a `screenshots/` directory
- **Action log**: A JSONL file recording every tool call and its arguments
- **Video**: Frame capture for playback in the UI

Results are written to a `results/` directory as `result.json` alongside the evidence files.

## Installation

Gauntlet ships as a `gauntlet` command on your PATH. The package isn't published to a registry; it's consumed via a local clone, with `bun link` registering the repo's `bin` entry globally so every shell sees it.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- Google Chrome (or Chromium) — required for the `web` adapter; the CDP driver works against either
- `tmux` — required for the `tui` adapter
- An LLM credential — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment, or a Claude subscription via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (see [Using a Claude subscription (OAuth)](#using-a-claude-subscription-oauth))

### Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:prime-radiant-inc/gauntlet.git
cd gauntlet
bun install
bun link            # registers the package globally; adds `gauntlet` to ~/.bun/bin
```

Verify:

```bash
cd /tmp
gauntlet            # prints usage
gauntlet config     # reads project + env config
```

`~/.bun/bin` is on your PATH after `bun.sh/install`. If `gauntlet: command not found`, add `~/.bun/bin` to PATH manually.

### Upgrade

```bash
cd <gauntlet-repo>
git pull
bun install
```

The symlink already points at the repo — no re-link needed.

### Uninstall

```bash
cd <gauntlet-repo>
bun unlink
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Run a story against a target URL
gauntlet run story.md --target http://localhost:3000

# Run with a specific model, adapter, viewport, and time budget
gauntlet run story.md --target http://localhost:3000 --model agent=claude-sonnet-4-6 --adapter web --viewport 1440x900 --max-time 5m

# Stream machine-readable events instead of the pretty terminal transcript
gauntlet run story.md --target http://localhost:3000 --format jsonl

# Suppress the run transcript and only print the runId on stderr
gauntlet run story.md --target http://localhost:3000 --silent

# Run a set of cards serially with a live progress display
gauntlet batch story-a.md story-b.md --target http://localhost:3000

# Glob-expanded set; exit 0 iff every card passes, 1 otherwise
gauntlet batch stories/*.md --target https://staging.example.com

# Validate a story card's format
gauntlet validate story.md

# Generate test variations from a story card
gauntlet fanout story.md --out ./stories

# Generate follow-up stories from a previous result
gauntlet fanout --from-result ./results/run-001 --out ./stories

# Start the web server — point --project-dir at the project's root
# (Gauntlet writes state to <project>/.gauntlet/).
gauntlet serve --port 4400 --project-dir ../my-app
```

### Batch mode

`gauntlet batch <story.md> [more.md ...] --target <url>` runs N cards
serially. The active card sits at the bottom as a single redrawing
spinner line; finished cards stack above as committed result rows. The
final summary tells you where evidence landed.

```
Gauntlet · 3 cards · target https://app.local

  ✓ login-matt              pass          6 turns · 4.2s
        → /…/.gauntlet/results/login-matt_…/
  ! login-not-logged-in     investigate   9 turns · 8.1s
        → /…/.gauntlet/results/login-not-logged-in_…/
  ⠋ [3/3] login-locked-out   turn 4

batch: 1 pass · 0 fail · 1 investigate · 0 errored
results: /…/.gauntlet/results
```

Per-card flags (`--target`, `--adapter`, `--model`, `--chrome`,
`--max-time`, `--reflection-interval`, `--viewport`, `--save-screencast`,
`--project-dir`) apply uniformly to every card. `--out` is rejected — each card uses its
default per-run directory under `<.gauntlet>/results/<runId>/`.

Output modes:

- **Default** (TTY): the live ticker shown above.
- **`--format jsonl`**: every per-event log line on stdout, with
  `runId` injected. No table. This is the CI / machine-readable mode.
- **`--silent`**: stdout is empty; the one-line summary lands on
  stderr. The exit code (`0` iff every card is `pass`, `1` otherwise)
  is the only other signal.

Errors don't abort the batch — a card that throws is marked errored
and the loop moves on. Concurrent execution (`-j N`) isn't implemented
yet; v1 is strictly serial.

To see Chrome's launch banners (silent by default to keep the ticker
clean), set `GAUNTLET_CHROME_VERBOSE=1`.

### Web UI

Run `gauntlet serve` to start the server (default port 4400). The UI provides:

- **Cards view**: Browse, create, and edit story cards in a sidebar-driven interface.
- **Runs view**: See all test results with status badges (pass/fail/investigate), view summaries, observations, and screenshot evidence.
- **Run detail**: Watch video playback of the test, read the agent's reasoning, see token usage, and trigger fanout (generate variations, investigate failures).
- **Live run**: Start a test from the UI and watch it execute in real-time via WebSocket -- see the browser frames update and the LLM's output stream in.

### API

The HTTP API (Hono) serves at `/api`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/scenarios` | GET | List all story cards |
| `/api/scenarios` | POST | Create a new story card |
| `/api/scenarios/:id` | GET | Get a single card |

## Docker

Run a story from the current directory against a target URL — the container mounts your working directory and reads `story.md`:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -e GAUNTLET_AGENT_MODEL=gpt-5-mini \
  -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work \
  gauntlet run story.md --target https://example.com
```

On macOS/Windows, use `--target http://host.docker.internal:3000` to reach a dev server running on the host.

The Docker image includes Chromium (multi-arch — works on both amd64 and arm64), Bun, and the pre-built UI, on Debian bookworm-slim. For production deployments that prefer Google Chrome, the separate `docker/Dockerfile.chrome` builds a standalone headless Chrome sidecar (amd64 only).

### Docker Compose

For persistent server use — the web UI, repeat runs, multiple stories — Compose is more ergonomic, mostly because it reads a `.env` file so API keys and defaults live in one place instead of on every `docker run` invocation:

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in your API keys
docker compose up
```

By default this mounts `.` (the Gauntlet repo itself) as the project root and Gauntlet writes state under `./.gauntlet/`. Story cards live at `.gauntlet/stories/`, run artifacts at `.gauntlet/results/`.

## Configuration

Gauntlet loads its runtime configuration once at startup via `loadConfig(argv, env)`. The result is an `AppConfig` object that flows explicitly through every command, route factory, and adapter. There is exactly one place that reads `process.env` for Gauntlet-level config; everything else takes its inputs as arguments.

### Precedence

```
defaults < environment variables < CLI flags < per-request body (web only)
```

The web `POST /api/run/:id` body is validated against an explicit allow-list. Unknown fields are rejected with HTTP 400. Every field exposed to the web is a conscious decision.

### CLI flags per command

| Command | Flag | Description |

| `ask` | (positional `<runId>`) | Open an interactive REPL against a completed run, replaying its conversation up to a chosen turn |
| `ask` | `--turn <n>` | Cut off at turn N (default: include all turns) |
| `ask` | `--model <model-id>` | Override the recorded model (default: pin to recorded) |
| `ask` | `--project-dir <dir>` | Project root (contains `.gauntlet/results/<runId>`) |

Unknown flags are now rejected loudly. If you mistype `--chrom` you will get an error, not silent fallthrough.

### Environment variables

Gauntlet-prefixed (consumed by `loadConfig`):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GAUNTLET_PORT` | Server port | `4400` |
| `GAUNTLET_PROJECT_ROOT` | Project root (contains `.gauntlet/` state dir) | `.` |
| `GAUNTLET_CHROME` | Default Chrome endpoint (`host:port`) | `127.0.0.1:9222` |
| `GAUNTLET_TARGET` | Default target URL, surfaced as a UI prefill | -- |
| `GAUNTLET_MAX_TIME` | Default wall-clock budget per run; accepts ms/s/m/h or bare seconds | `5m` |
| `GAUNTLET_REFLECTION_INTERVAL` | Default reflection-checkpoint interval (turns; `0` disables) | `10` |
| `GAUNTLET_VIEWPORT` | Default browser viewport (`WxH`) | `1440x900` |
| `GAUNTLET_SAVE_SCREENCAST` | Persist screencast frames to disk (`1/0`, `true/false`, `yes/no`, `on/off`) | `0` |
| `GAUNTLET_AGENT_MODEL` | Default agent model | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `GAUNTLET_FANOUT_MODEL` | Default fanout model | -- |
| `GAUNTLET_MODELS` | Comma-separated allow-list of models (opt-in) | `[]` (no restriction) |
| `GAUNTLET_CHROME_VERBOSE` | Print Chrome lifecycle messages (reconnect, startup, session dir) on stderr. Any truthy string activates it. | unset |

### SDK env pass-through policy

Gauntlet does **not** read, wrap, or re-export the SDK-native environment variables — with one exception, a Claude subscription token (see below). Otherwise they flow directly to the Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs via the empty-constructor pattern (`new Anthropic()`, `new OpenAI()`).

| Variable | Owned by |
|----------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_LOG` | Anthropic SDK |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_ORG_ID`, `OPENAI_PROJECT` | OpenAI SDK |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` | Both SDKs (via Node) |

If you want to point Gauntlet at a custom Anthropic endpoint, set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-gateway.example.com` directly. Gauntlet will not touch it; the SDK will.

`gauntlet config` records the *presence* of API keys in its output (`apiKeys.anthropic: set`) but never their values.

### Using a Claude subscription (OAuth)

For Claude models, Gauntlet can authenticate with a **logged-in Claude subscription** instead of a pay-per-token API key — useful for running Gauntlet's QA driver against your existing Max/Pro plan.

1. Mint a long-lived token (interactive, one-time):

   ```bash
   claude setup-token
   ```

2. Put it in your environment as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (e.g. in `.env`). When present, Gauntlet **prefers it over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**; the API key remains the fallback. (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is accepted as an alias.)

Unlike the other Anthropic env vars, Gauntlet reads this one explicitly: it constructs the client with the token as `authToken` (Bearer), sends the `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header, and — because Anthropic gates subscription tokens to Claude Code — prepends the exact Claude Code identity (`"You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude."`) as the **first** system block of every request, with the QA system prompt following. A request missing that framing is rejected with `429`.

**Caveat:** that identity block means the Gauntlet-Agent (the grader) runs under a "you are Claude Code" preface ahead of its QA instructions. The QA prompt itself is unchanged (it's the second block), so the effect is small, but it is a behavioral nudge worth knowing when comparing API-key vs subscription runs.

`gauntlet config` shows `anthropic: set` whenever either credential is present.

### Inspecting effective config

```bash
gauntlet config              # formatted text with per-field source attribution
gauntlet config --json       # machine-readable
GAUNTLET_PORT=5500 gauntlet config --project-dir /tmp/x
#   port:           5500  (env)
#   projectRoot:    /tmp/x  (flag)
```

The same payload is available over HTTP at `GET /api/config/effective` once the server is running.

### Docker / compose pattern

Use `GAUNTLET_CHROME` to point at a sidecar Chrome service:

```yaml
services:
  gauntlet:
    environment:
      GAUNTLET_CHROME: chrome:9222
      GAUNTLET_AGENT_MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-6
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
```
