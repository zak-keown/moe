// Bump when result.json format changes in a way downstream consumers must notice.
// Documented in docs/format.md.
//
// v2: added optional `config` block capturing the per-run knobs (target,
//     model, adapter, chrome, budgetMs) so the UI can offer a "Run again"
//     action without re-eliciting the parameters.
// v3: RunConfigSnapshot.turns replaced with budgetMs (wall-clock budget
//     in ms) and maxStuckRetries (prompt-injected stuck-retry hint).
//     Reflects the time-budget loop replacing maxTurns. See
//     docs/history/specs/2026-05-11-time-budget-and-stuck-detection-spec.md.
// v4: Removed maxStuckRetries (the stuck-handling system-prompt block it
//     templated into has been retired in favor of mid-loop reflection
//     checkpoints — see docs/reflection-checkpoints-spec.md, PRI-1569).
// v5: Added "errored" to VerdictStatus and optional error: {type, message}
//     field on VerdictResult. Today's only emitter is shutdown drain
//     (PRI-1507) — type is "shutdown_interrupted". The error.type field
//     is open-typed (string) so additive new categories don't require a
//     schema bump or TypeScript widening; consumers MUST tolerate
//     unknown types. For shutdown-stub results (the floor-of-quality
//     fallback when even the post-abort patience window expires),
//     duration_ms uses -1 as a sentinel meaning "registry entry was
//     missing startedAt at stub time".
