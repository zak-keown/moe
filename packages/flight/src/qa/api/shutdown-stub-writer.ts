/**
 * The floor-of-quality fallback for the shutdown drain story (PRI-1507):
 * when the post-abort patience window also expires with runs still in
 * flight, write a minimal `result.json` for each so `/api/results/:runId`
 * returns 200 with an errored manifest instead of 404 with an orphan dir.
 *
 * Race safety: writes ONLY if `result.json` does not already exist. The
 * only competing writer is the agent loop's success path
 * (`writeResultFiles` inside `executeRunCore`), which by spec §3's
 * ordering invariant runs BEFORE the wrapper's `afterClose` → registry
 * unregister. So a run still listed in the registry at stub time
 * provably has not yet written `result.json`.
 *
 * If the patience window happens to expire RIGHT as a slow agent loop
 * finishes — `writeResultFiles` between disk-flush and the
 * `afterClose`/unregister — the `existsSync` check will see the
 * real file and skip the stub. The narrow race that remains (file
 * created between the existsSync check and our writeFileSync) would
 * mean the real result.json gets overwritten by our stub, but only
 * if the agent's writeFileSync happens AFTER ours starts AND completes
 * BEFORE ours completes. `writeFileSync` is synchronous on the same
 * thread, so the window is microseconds — not zero, but small enough
 * to live with given the alternative (full atomic-rename plumbing).
