/**
 * Graceful daemon shutdown for `moe-flight qa serve`. PRI-1477A + PRI-1507.
 *
 * On SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP the daemon should:
 *   1. Mark itself as draining so new POSTs return 503
 *   2. Close existing WS connections with code 1001 ("going away")
 *   3. Wait up to `MOE_FLIGHT_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS` for in-flight runs to complete
 *   4. If runs are still in flight after grace:
 *      a. cancelTokens.cancelAll() — gate run-set loops from starting more attempts
 *      b. registry.abortAll() — fire per-run AbortControllers so agent loops exit
 *      c. wait up to postAbortMs (default 1000) for runs to write result.json
 *      d. writeShutdownStubs for any run still missing result.json
 *   5. Stop the HTTP server and `process.exit(0)`
 *
 * See spec/plan: docs/history/specs/2026-05-13-shutdown-drain-cancellation-spec.md
