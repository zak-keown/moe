/**
 * Per-profile MCP-instance lock.
 *
 * The bridge defaults every MCP server to the `moe-glass` profile,
 * which means two MCP processes running on the same host silently end up
 * driving the same Chrome (the second one reconnects to the first's instance
 * via the meta.json path). Their `activeTab` pointers stomp on each other and
 * the agents fight over tabs without any error surfacing.
 *
 * The fix is to claim a per-process lock file next to the profile dir and,
 * on conflict with a live holder, auto-pick an unused alternate name
 * (`moe-glass-2`, `-3`, etc.). The first MCP keeps the simple
 * default; later MCPs get their own Chrome silently.
 *
 * Layout:
 *   ~/.cache/moe/browser-profiles/<profile>/                 — Chrome user-data-dir
 *   ~/.cache/moe/browser-profiles/<profile>.meta.json        — port/pid (Chrome process)
 *   ~/.cache/moe/browser-profiles/<profile>.mcp.lock         — MCP-instance lock
 *
 * Semantics:
 *   - `acquireWithFallback(base)` is the entry point used by chrome-process.js.
 *     It tries `base`, then `base-2`, `base-3`, ... until it claims one or
 *     runs out of slots. Returns { profileName, lockPath }.
 *   - `acquire(profileName)` is a single-profile try-lock. Returns the
 *     lock path on success, `null` on live-holder conflict, and throws on
 *     unexpected I/O errors.
 *   - `release(lockPath)` removes the lock; safe to call unconditionally.
 *   - A lock whose pid is no longer alive is treated as stale and overwritten
 *     atomically.
 *   - File creation uses `wx` flag for atomicity — two MCPs starting at the
 *     same millisecond can't both win.
 *
 * Lock file shape:
 *   { pid: number, mcpPid: number, startedAt: ISO8601, version: number }
 *   `version` is the on-disk format; bump if the shape ever changes.
