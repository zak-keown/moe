# Changelog

All notable changes to the superpowers-chrome MCP project.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-08-07 - Reliability and hardening across the MCP and CLI launch paths

### Fixed
- MCP tool errors now set `isError: true` on the CallToolResult (#44). Thrown handler errors were returned as ordinary text, so clients recorded failures as successes and loop breakers keying on the error flag never engaged (observed as ~300 consecutive identical failing calls in one agent session). The one in-band error-string return (`extract`'s element-not-found) now throws, with identical user-visible text; the DialogRefusal synthetic response deliberately stays non-error.
- `CHROME_WS_BROWSER` is honored by the MCP launch path (PR #41, partially addresses #40). It was documented and honored by the CLI but silently ignored by `chrome-process.js`. A set-but-missing path warns on stderr and falls back to auto-detection; the not-found error names the override.
- The MCP server exits when its host goes away instead of leaking (PR #42, partially addresses #40). Shutdown on stdin end/close, transport close, and a 30s ppid watchdog; exiting releases the profile lock so the next server reclaims the profile and reconnects to the existing Chrome instead of spawning another.
- `chrome-ws start` honors `CHROME_EXTRA_ARGS` via the shared `buildChromeArgs()` helper (PR #37, partially addresses #35). CLI start stays headed by default; the shared baseline flags mean headless-Linux-as-root works with no env var at all.
- The schema-collapse dead-Chrome test faked only `isPortAlive`, so its kill path SIGTERMed whatever real process held port 9222 (intermittently killing the smoke test's Chrome mid-suite) and its restart path spawned and leaked a real Chrome with profile `test`. The harness now fakes every process-reaching helper.
- Chrome's sandbox stays on except where it cannot work (#45). `--no-sandbox` was unconditional in the shared launch flags; it is now emitted only when `sandboxDisableNeeded()` detects root or a container (`/.dockerenv`, `/proc/1/cgroup` markers). `CHROME_EXTRA_ARGS` still force-adds it anywhere.
- A Chrome spawn failure (async `'error'` on the ChildProcess — e.g. `CHROME_WS_BROWSER` pointing at the `.app` bundle instead of the inner binary) no longer crashes the MCP server as an uncaught exception; `startChrome` rejects with the binary path in the message (#46).
- Host-lifecycle hardening (#47): close/error handlers moved from `transport.onclose` (overwritten at `connect()` by older SDK 1.x versions within our range) to the version-stable `server.server.onclose`/`onerror`; the ppid watchdog interval is configurable via `CHROME_WS_PPID_WATCHDOG_MS` (0 disables); an error-driven transport close (oversized frame with a live host) exits 1 instead of reporting success. Both previously untested shutdown signals now have behavioral tests.
- All tests now point `XDG_CACHE_HOME` at per-run temp dirs, so the suite (including crashed runs) can no longer delete real profile meta files for live MCP sessions or litter the user's real cache directory with test profiles.
- `chrome-ws start` failure reporting (#35, remaining asks): Chrome's stderr is captured to a tempfile and surfaced on failure (previously discarded via `stdio: 'ignore'`, so e.g. `Running as root without --no-sandbox is not supported.` vanished); Chrome exiting before the port poll is reported as `Chrome exited with code N before opening the debug port` instead of the misleading "remote debugging not accessible"; a still-running Chrome with an unresponsive port gets its own distinct message; and a spawn failure (e.g. `CHROME_WS_BROWSER` pointing at a directory) produces a clean one-line error instead of an uncaught exception.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-08-05 - Dependency security updates (all 21 Dependabot alerts)

### Security
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.20.1 → 1.30.0, closing three advisories against the bundled SDK: DNS rebinding protection not enabled by default, cross-client data leak via shared server/transport reuse, and a ReDoS. The two transport-level issues only affect HTTP transports (this server is stdio-only), but the SDK is baked into the shipped `mcp/dist/index.js`, so the vulnerable code was distributed regardless of reachability.
- Transitive express-stack deps refreshed with the SDK, closing eight DoS-class advisories: `body-parser` 2.3.0, `qs` 6.15.3, `ajv` 8.20.0, `path-to-regexp` 8.4.2.
- `undici` 7.25.0 → 7.29.0 (root devDependency via `jsdom`, eleven advisories; never shipped to users — recorded here for the audit trail).

No package.json ranges changed; every update was within existing semver. Bundle rebuilt (574KB → 776KB from ten SDK minor versions); 496/496 tests pass.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-08-05 - Stringified JSON payloads work for structured actions

### Fixed
- `use_browser` payload handling (PR #43): a JSON-stringified payload for `set_viewport` or `mouse_move` (e.g. `payload: '{"width":390,"height":844}'`, common when client tooling always `JSON.stringify`s arguments) was wrapped literally instead of parsed, then failed with a misleading "requires payload with width and height" even though both fields were supplied. Payload normalization is now extracted into `mcp/src/payload.ts`, driven by a per-action `PAYLOAD_SPECS` table: `'structured'` actions accept an equivalent JSON-encoded string anywhere an object works, while `'scalar'` actions (`eval`, `type`, `await_text`, `select`) are never JSON-parsed — `eval` given `[1, 2]` stays a JS array literal, not a parsed JSON array.
- `set_viewport`/`mouse_move` errors now distinguish no-payload / unparseable-JSON / parsed-but-wrong-fields instead of one generic "missing" message; `scroll`'s valid-JSON-but-wrong-shape case (`'[1,2]'`, `'5'`) reports an honest detail instead of an empty one (previously it silently scrolled by 0).
- `get_console_messages` accepts a bare epoch-ms payload (`payload: "1785900000000"` works like `{since: 1785900000000}`); a supplied `since` that can't be a timestamp is now an explicit error instead of silently returning every message unfiltered.
- `scroll`/`drag_drop`'s hand-rolled `JSON.parse` fallbacks folded into shared `tryParseJsonObject`/`tryParseCoords` primitives; `scroll`'s string-derived deltas now get the same `typeof number` validation as its object path. CSS attribute selectors like `[data-foo]` are never misparsed as JSON (guarded by prefix gate + tests).

### Tests
- New `test/payload-normalization.test.mjs` (61 tests) executes the compiled normalization logic directly — behavioral coverage replacing the source-text-grep style that let this bug ship. Covers the stringified/native equivalence for every structured action, the never-parse guarantee for every scalar action, the `since` coercion matrix, and the BOM/whitespace edge semantics preserved through the decode consolidation.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-31 - IPv6-disabled loopback no longer blocks Chrome launch

### Fixed
- `skills/browsing/lib/chrome-launcher-helpers.js`: `isPortFree()` probed both `127.0.0.1` and `::1` and treated *any* `::1` bind failure as "port occupied". In a container with IPv6 loopback disabled (`net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1`), every `::1` bind returns `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, so every port in 9222–12111 looked occupied and `findAvailablePort()` threw "No available port" — Chrome never launched. Now distinguishes a genuine in-use signal (`EADDRINUSE`) from an unavailable loopback/address-family (`EADDRNOTAVAIL`/`EAFNOSUPPORT`): the dual-stack check stays a race-guard for hosts where Chrome may bind `::1` only, but a missing IPv6 loopback no longer vetoes the port. Decision extracted into a pure `portFreeFromProbes(v4, v6)` and unit-tested with both error codes; `isPortFreeOn` now resolves `{free, code}`.

### Tests
- `test/lib/chrome-process.test.mjs`: the two `getBrowserMode` "no listener → running:false" tests inherited the shared default `activePort` 9222, which the real-Chrome smoke suite binds — so they flaked under `node --test`'s parallel file execution (intermittent `running:true`). They now probe port 1 (privileged/unbound, deterministic), matching the sibling test. `npm test` is stable across parallel runs.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-22 - Lint fix

3.0.0 shipped with five unused-variable lint errors that `npm test`
gates on. Functional code was unaffected (428/428 tests passed when
run directly), but the canonical test command failed.

### Fixed
- `skills/browsing/lib/navigation.js`: removed the unused `dialogResolver` let-binding from the dialog-race promise (the closure used the inner `resolve` directly).
- `test/lib/chrome-process.test.mjs`: dropped unused `path`, `state`, and `fs` requires from the profile-lock integration tests.
- `test/lib/profile-lock.test.mjs`: removed unused `before` and `after` imports from `node:test` (only `beforeEach`/`afterEach` are used).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-22 - Schema reshape, dialog mid-navigate, multi-MCP isolation

This release is the union of 2.2.0's flatten-mode CDP bridge with the
schema/UX/correctness work that came out of running the 14-scenario
agent-driven eval corpus against it. Anyone upgrading from 2.1.0 should
read the **Changed** section — the MCP tool's parameter shape is
different, though tab_index is Postel-accepted to keep older agent
prompts working.

### Added

- **Auto-disambiguation of the default Chrome profile across parallel MCPs.** Until now every MCP server on the host defaulted to `superpowers-chrome` on port 9222, so a second MCP silently reconnected to the first's Chrome and the two agents fought over `activeTab` with no error surfaced. The bridge now claims a per-process lock file at `~/.cache/superpowers/browser-profiles/<profile>.mcp.lock`; on conflict with a live PID it falls through to `<base>-2`, `-3`, ... The first MCP keeps the simple default; later ones silently get their own Chrome. Stale locks (dead PIDs) are reclaimed automatically. See `skills/browsing/lib/profile-lock.js`.
- **`CHROME_WS_PROFILE` env var** for opting out of auto-disambiguation. Set to a profile name (alphanumeric/hyphen/underscore) and the bridge treats the profile as explicit — it acquires the named lock and, on conflict, *shares* the Chrome (the original reconnect-on-restart behavior) instead of picking an alternate. Same opt-out applies when `set_profile` is called at runtime.
- **`switch_tab` action** + sticky `activeTab` state. Match by integer index, URL substring, or title substring. `new_tab` updates `activeTab` to the newly-opened tab; `close_tab` closes the active tab. Tab routing is no longer baked into every action's parameters — the user picks once, subsequent actions follow.
- **Chrome lifecycle actions:** `kill_chrome` and `restart_chrome`. The MCP exposes them so agents can recover from a wedged or stale Chrome without restarting the MCP server itself.
- **Console logging actions:** `enable_console_logging`, `get_console_messages` (with optional `payload.since` epoch-ms filter), `clear_console_messages`. State is keyed by the page session's `sessionId`, not by tab index — log buffers survive `close_tab`/`new_tab`.
- **Auto-restart banner.** When `ensureChromeRunning` had to spawn a fresh Chrome (because the prior one died or was killed externally), the first action's response prepends `[Chrome auto-restarted; URL reset to about:blank. Re-navigate to continue.]` so the model knows its previous URL/tab state is gone.
- **`navigate` surfaces mid-load dialogs.** A basic-auth challenge, permission prompt, or other dialog that fires *during* a `Page.navigate` used to wedge the navigate for the full 30 s timeout; the response was a generic CDP timeout with no mention of the staged dialog. `navigate` now races the load wait against dialog detection and throws `DialogRefusedError` as soon as `state.dialogs[sid]` is populated — the response text includes the `dialog::*` grammar so the agent knows what to do next.
- **`browser_mode` reports the real PID for adopted Chrome.** When the bridge reconnected to a Chrome it didn't spawn (via meta.json or orphan adoption), it used to return `{pid: null, running: false}` even though the CDP was working. It now resolves the PID via meta.json or a port scan and verifies with `isPortAlive` before reporting `running: true`.
- **CLI `chrome-ws stop`** — the `stop` subcommand was advertised in `--help` but had no dispatch. Implemented now: calls `session.killChrome()` and prints `Chrome stopped` on success.
- **CLI clearer error on unknown commands.** Used to print the `raw`-specific usage banner for any unknown command (so `chrome-ws stp` would suggest the `raw` syntax). Now prints `Unknown command: <name>` and points at `--help`.
- **14-scenario agent-driven test corpus** at `tests/scenarios/*.md`. Each is a self-contained prompt a worker can execute end-to-end against the bridge. The corpus is now deterministic across fresh worker sessions — most early flakiness was test-author judgment leaking into the spec (fallback URLs, "use the right tab", "click the right thing"); the rewrite removes that ambiguity. See `tests/scenarios/README.md`.

### Changed

- **`use_browser` MCP schema collapsed to 4 parameters:** `action`, `selector`, `payload`, `timeout`. `selector` is now a top-level CSS/XPath string. `payload` is `string | object | undefined` — strings work for the common case (`navigate=URL`, `type=text`, `eval=JS`, `keyboard_press=key`, `switch_tab=match-string`), objects for the structured cases (`set_viewport={width,height,mobile?}`, `drag_drop={target}`, `extract={format}`, `screenshot={path,fullpage?}`, etc.). `tab_index` is **Postel-accepted** as a legacy alias for an implicit `switch_tab` — older agent prompts continue to work; the schema description steers new callers to `switch_tab`. Pre-3.0 callers that hardcoded `selector` inside `payload` keep working too (the parsers accept the bare-string form per action).
- **Postel acceptance** for several actions: `attr` accepts a bare string payload (the attribute name); `drag_drop` accepts a bare `{x,y}` payload or a target-selector string; `extract` accepts a bare string payload as the format (`"text"`, `"html"`, `"markdown"`); `keyboard_press` accepts shifted-letter keys. Tests in `test/mcp-postel-fixes.test.mjs`.
- **`navigate` throws on net errors.** A CDP `Page.navigate` that returns `errorText` (DNS failure, refused connection, unsafe port) used to silently report success. It now throws `Navigate failed: <netError> (<url>)`.
- **JS dialog accept/dismiss clears state.dialogs eagerly.** The router used to rely solely on Chrome firing `Page.javascriptDialogClosed` for cleanup. That event sometimes arrived late, was routed to a session without `Page.enable`, or simply didn't fire on transient dialog states — `state.dialogs[sid]` then stayed populated and the next action got "Page is behind a dialog" forever. The router now signals `clearDialog: true` for JS-kind accept/dismiss and the caller deletes the entry immediately; Chrome's event becomes a redundant best-effort sweep.
- **Mouse click skips its Element.click() fallback when a dialog is open.** The catch block used to assume any press/release timeout was a coordinate problem and fall through to `_el.click()` via `Runtime.evaluate`. When the original click had opened a dialog, that fallback queued a second click event behind the dialog — and dismissing the dialog later spawned a *second* confirm. Now the catch checks `dialogs.getOpen(ps.sessionId)` and, if a dialog is up, propagates the original timeout instead. The fallback still runs for genuine coordinate failures (hidden element, zero bbox).
- **`mouse_move` uses a humanised Bezier path** with variable speed and per-step jitter. Same `lastMousePos` tracking so chained `mouse_move` calls start from the cursor's actual position rather than (0, 0).
- **`screenshot` resolves relative paths** against the current working directory; bare filenames are saved into the auto-capture session directory as before.
- **`new_tab` navigates to its payload URL** rather than opening blank-then-navigating, so the new-tab response includes the loaded page's URL and the `activeTab` pointer is correct on return.
- **Single console-message writer.** `navigation.js` used to write to `state.consoleMessages` *and* `console-logging.js` did too — they raced on `Runtime.consoleAPICalled` timestamps and produced duplicate entries that the dedup-by-last-entry path couldn't catch (1 ms timestamp drift). `navigation.js` no longer touches that buffer; `console-logging.js` is the single writer.
- **`get_console_messages` filters by `payload.since`** (epoch ms) — entries with timestamps before the cutoff are dropped. Use to fetch only the entries from the latest navigation.

### Fixed

- **Plugin version bump to 3.0.0 across `package.json`, `mcp/package.json`, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — these had drifted between 2.0.0 / 2.1.0 / 2.2.0 in the bridge worktree, which caused Claude Code's plugin loader to pick non-deterministically between the bridge plugin and any cached marketplace copy of the same name. Stable single-version disambiguation now.
- **Adopted-orphan Chrome accumulation.** When the bridge connects to a leftover Chrome from a prior MCP session and that Chrome then dies, the bridge used to leave the meta.json untouched and accumulate zombie meta entries. Adoption now writes a fresh meta and the killChrome path clears it.
- **`chrome-ws close` accepts numeric tab indices.** Previously the CLI's `close` subcommand only matched ws-URLs; passing `0`/`1`/`2` failed. Now resolves a numeric arg to the corresponding tab index, matching every other `chrome-ws` subcommand.
- **`keyboard_press` accepts any printable key.** The dispatch table used to whitelist a small set of special keys (Tab, Enter, F1-F12, etc.) and reject everything else. Now any single-character key is dispatched as a regular keydown/keyup, with the existing `modifiers: {shift, ctrl, alt, meta}` option preserved.
- **Dialog::* click skips post-action capture.** The auto-capture wrapper used to issue a `Runtime.evaluate` for the after-action capture *during* the page's resume from the dialog, which raced against the navigation/redirect that often follows accept/dismiss and timed out. Dialog selectors now return early from capture.
- **`pageSession` pinned at action start.** `clickWithCapture` (and its peers) used to resolve `getPageSession(0)` separately for the action and for the post-action capture. When the action opened a popup, Chrome inserted the popup at index 0 between resolution and capture, so the capture ran against the wrong tab. The action now resolves `pageSession` once and threads the same instance through.
- **Focus restoration uses `el.focus({preventScroll: true})`.** A capture-wrapper that restored focus after an action used to scroll the page to the focused element, polluting screenshots/diffs with unintended `scroll: 0` events.

### Documentation

- **`docs/cdp/` reference cards** for the CDP semantics this bridge depends on: flatten-mode, per-session id counters, target lifecycle, autoAttach popup timing, navigation listener race, headless variants. Index at `docs/cdp/INDEX.md`.
- **Implementation plans** under `docs/superpowers/plans/`: `2026-05-21-flatten-mode-bridge.md` (the original bridge plan), `2026-05-22-mcp-schema-reshape.md` (the parameter collapse).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-21 - Flatten-mode CDP bridge + popup support

### Added
- **Flatten-mode CDP bridge.** The per-page WebSocket pool is replaced with a single browser-WS using CDP flatten mode + sessionId routing. Four new modules under `skills/browsing/lib/`: `browser-session.js` (the one root WS, lazy connect, sendRaw escape hatch), `cdp-router.js` (sessionId-aware dispatcher), `page-session.js` (per-page flatten-mode session with independent id-counter), `browser-bridge.js` (targets tracking, BrowserContext, autoAttach).
- **Popup support via `Target.setAutoAttach`** with `waitForDebuggerOnStart:true`. Every new target (popups, OAuth windows, child frames) is paused at attach; the dialog shim (`Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` + `Runtime.addBinding`) is installed; then `Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger` resumes. Popups with synchronously-fired confirm/alert/permission dialogs are now reliable. Integration test at `test/popup-dialog-integration.test.mjs`.
- **`BrowserContext` API** via `bridge.createBrowserContext({proxyServer?})` — incognito-style isolation with atomic dispose.
- **6 curated CDP reference cards** under `docs/cdp/` (flatten-mode, per-session-id-counters, target-lifecycle, autoattach-popup-timing, navigation-listener-race, headless-variants) for maintainers.
- **`state.ensureBridge()`** — lazy bridge attach in chrome-ws-lib; safe to call repeatedly, retries on failure.

### Changed
- **All 12 action libs migrated** to the `getPageSession` resolver shape: mouse, keyboard-input, evaluation, screenshot, navigation, extraction, file-upload, select-option, viewport, cookies, capture, console-logging. Internal change only — user-facing API (`session.click(tab, selector)` etc.) is unchanged.
- **Dialog subsystem rewritten** on top of the bridge: state keyed by `sessionId`, event handlers attached via `pageSession.onEvent`. The pool-keyed `dialogs.attachToConnection` path is retired. Dialog selector grammar (`dialog::accept` etc.) and `DialogRefusedError` semantics are unchanged.
- **Navigation lib simplified.** The second-WebSocket listener pattern (used for streaming console + waiting for `Page.loadEventFired`) is gone — `pageSession.onEvent` + `pageSession.waitForEvent` cover both needs on the one bridge socket.
- **Console-logging lib simplified.** Same idea — no more separate WebSocket; uses `pageSession.onEvent`.
- **`killChrome` calls `closeBridge` first** with a 500ms timeout fallback, so SIGTERM isn't blocked by a hung close.

### Removed
- **`skills/browsing/lib/cdp-connection.js`** — the per-page connection pool. ~190 lines deleted.
- **`state.connectionPool`** field — no longer needed.
- The silent single-use-WS fallback in the old `sendCdpCommand` — now a hard fail at the bridge layer; callers decide.

### Architecture notes for maintainers
- See `docs/cdp/INDEX.md` for the 6 reference cards documenting the CDP semantics we depend on.
- See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-21-flatten-mode-bridge.md` for the full implementation plan including the E9 timing finding and the Phase F resolution.
- Inspired by external PR #34 (mhat) — architecture was sound; we rewrote on current main to integrate with the dialog subsystem cleanly and added the autoAttach/popup wiring that wasn't in the original.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-14 - Dialog handling

### Added
- **Dialog handling.** JS dialogs (`alert` / `confirm` / `prompt` / `beforeunload`), WebUSB / Bluetooth / Serial / HID device choosers, permission prompts (camera / microphone / notifications / geolocation / clipboard — via a `document_start` JS-API shim), and HTTP basic-auth challenges no longer wedge the CDP connection. Each dialog is surfaced as a synthetic "page" that the agent interacts with using the existing `click` and `type` actions against a small `dialog::*` selector grammar: `dialog::accept`, `dialog::dismiss`, `dialog::prompt`, `dialog::device[id="..."]`, `dialog::username`, `dialog::password`. While a dialog is open, page-targeted actions (`extract`, `screenshot`, `eval`, `click <real-selector>`, etc.) return a clear refusal that includes the dialog content and handling instructions; browser-targeted actions (`list_tabs`, `new_tab`, `close_tab`, etc.) pass through unaffected. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-dialog-handling-design.md` for the full design.

### Changed
- The pooled CDP connection now enables `Runtime` (in addition to `Page` / `DeviceAccess` / `Fetch`) so that `Runtime.addBinding` can plumb the permission-shim binding into page main worlds. Required for Chrome 148+.
- Page-targeted actions that encounter an open dialog throw a typed `DialogRefusedError` from the session-boundary wrapper; the MCP top-level handler catches and formats it as a synthetic-dialog tool response. Internal architecture: every page-targeted session method (29 of them, enumerated in one Set) is gated at the `chrome-ws-lib` session boundary by a single wrapper, instead of relying on per-action middleware.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-06 - Per-session factory, three-tier test suite, and correctness fixes

Major release. Breaking changes for any external consumer of the lib's pre-factory module-level state or the legacy method aliases. The MCP server and CLI bundled with this plugin are unaffected — they use the canonical names.

### Added
- **`createSession({ host, port })`** factory in `chrome-ws-lib.js` — returns a fresh state-bag with a private connection pool, console-message map, profile name, Chrome process handle, active CDP port, and host-override. Two sessions in one process don't share state. Unblocks any caller that wants to drive multiple Chromes concurrently from one Node process.
- **`createOverride({ host, port })`** factory in `host-override.js` — per-instance host/port/override-enabled state with `getHost`, `getPort`, `getBase`, `isOverrideEnabled`, `rewriteWsUrl`, `setDefaults`. Underpins per-session host-override in `createSession()`.
- **Three-tier test suite** (140 tests, up from 23): per-lib unit tests with mocked `sendCdpCommand`/`resolveWsUrl`, jsdom-backed integration tests for `select-option` and the page-side scripts, and a real-Chrome smoke suite gated on Chrome being installed.
- **Bundle drift detection** in `npm test`: a regex-scrape of `chromeLib.X(` calls in the bundle vs. the lib's actual exports, a subprocess test that the bundle responds to MCP `initialize`, and a pre-build-commit guard that fails CI if `mcp/dist/` would change after a fresh build.
- **Biome lint** with a minimal correctness/style ruleset, wired into `npm test`.
- **`findPidOnPort(port)`** cross-platform helper (lsof on macOS/Linux, netstat on Windows).
- **`test/session-isolation.test.mjs`** — regression gate covering per-session state isolation.

### Fixed
- **`evaluate()` now throws on JavaScript errors.** Previously, `evaluate`/`evaluateJson`/`evaluateRaw` returned `undefined` when the page-side JS threw or a Promise rejected — the `result.exceptionDetails` on the CDP response was never inspected. **This is a behavior change for callers**: code that relied on getting `undefined` for a failed evaluation will now see thrown errors. The MCP `eval` action and CLI `eval` command surface the error to the caller.
- **`waitForElement()` and `waitForText()` actually honor their timeout.** Both built their own `Runtime.evaluate` payload with a `setTimeout(reject)` for the timeout case but bypassed the `exceptionDetails` check, so the rejection was silently swallowed and the wait resolved as if the element/text was found. Now route through `evaluate()` so the timeout properly rejects. The MCP `await_element` and `await_text` actions inherit the fix.
- **`navigate()` no longer hangs 30 seconds on fast-loading pages.** `Page.enable` was being sent on the pooled connection, but Chrome scopes Page events per-connection — the listener WebSocket never received `Page.loadEventFired`. Now sends `Page.enable` on the listener connection itself. `Page.navigate` failures and enable-ack errors propagate to the caller (previously swallowed).
- **`startChrome()` polls Chrome's debug port instead of sleeping a fixed 2 seconds.** On slower machines Chrome can take longer than 2s to open the port; every subsequent CDP call would fail with `ECONNREFUSED`. Now polls every 200ms up to a 15-second deadline.
- **`killChrome()` works for sessions that reconnected to a Chrome they didn't launch.** Previously it early-returned when `state.chromeProcess` was null, leaving `showBrowser`/`hideBrowser` unable to free the port. Now falls back to `findPidOnPort(state.activePort)` and SIGTERMs the holder.
- **`generateHtmlDiff()` detects reordered identical lines.** Previous set-based logic returned "no changes" for any HTML where the line set was unchanged. Replaced with a hand-rolled Myers line diff.
- **Process exit handlers no longer leak per-session.** Previously every `initializeSession()` registered three new `process.on(...)` handlers; N sessions meant 3N handlers. Now registered once at module scope, iterating a Set of active session-cleanup callbacks.
- **CLI `chrome-ws eval` awaits Promises.** Previously called `Runtime.evaluate` without `awaitPromise:true`, so async expressions returned `{}` instead of resolved values.
- **CLI `chrome-ws select` supports labels and multi-select.** Previously did `el.value = X` directly with no support for visible-label match or JSON-array multi-select.
- **CLI `chrome-ws fill` errors on missing element.** Previously silent success with exit 0 when the selector didn't match.
- **CLI `chrome-ws wait-for [timeout-ms]` honors the timeout argument.** Previously ignored, falling through to the 30s CDP cap.
- **CLI `chrome-ws wait-text [timeout-ms]` honors the timeout argument.** Previously consumed the timeout into the search-text via `args.join(' ')`.
- **CLI `chrome-ws --port=N` actually targets that Chrome.** Previously the CLI's session was constructed without `--port`, so all delegating commands hit the env-default port.
- **CLI commands exit cleanly.** Previously hung indefinitely after success because pooled WebSocket connections kept Node alive; now `closeAllConnections()` runs on the success path.

### Changed
- **Consumer migration**: `mcp/src/index.ts` and `skills/browsing/chrome-ws` now construct sessions explicitly — `require('./chrome-ws-lib').createSession()` and `require('./host-override').createOverride()`.
- **CLI buggy commands delegate to the lib.** `eval`, `select`, `fill`, `wait-for`, `wait-text` now call `session.<method>` instead of constructing their own `Runtime.evaluate` payload. The CLI now inherits the lib's correctness fixes.
- **Page-side scripts extracted** from `lib/capture.js` into `lib/page-scripts/markdown.js` and `lib/page-scripts/dom-summary.js`. Same behavior; the scripts can now be linted and tested directly against jsdom.
- **CLI is now linted by Biome.** The CLI was previously excluded from the lint includes because it has no file extension; now in scope.

### Removed
- **Legacy module-level exports from `host-override.js`**: `CHROME_DEBUG_HOST`, `CHROME_DEBUG_PORT`, `CHROME_DEBUG_BASE`, `WS_OVERRIDE_ENABLED`, and top-level `rewriteWsUrl`. Use `createOverride()` instead.
- **Legacy method aliases on the session object**: `cdpClick` (use `click`), `insertText` (use `fill`). Internal-only `keyboardType`, `spaNavigate`, `hrefNavigate` also removed. External consumers should migrate to the canonical names.
- **`state.messageIdCounter`** from session state. CDP message ids are scoped per-connection; `id = 1` works for the single-use connection.
- **`skills/browsing/test-host-override.js`** smoke test (covered by `test/session-isolation.test.mjs`).

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-14 - Merge human_type into type

### Changed
- **`type` now uses realistic keystroke timing**: `type` calls `humanType()` internally, typing with natural inter-key delays (~80-160ms/char) and per-keystroke keyDown/keyUp events in headed mode
- **Removed `human_type` action**: No longer a separate action. Use `type` for all text input

### Removed
- `human_type` action — `type` now does the same thing

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-13 - Visibility-aware element selection, async eval, crash fix

### Fixed
- **Element selection prefers visible elements over hidden ones**: `getElementSelector()` now uses `querySelectorAll()` to find all matches and picks the first with a non-zero bounding rect. Previously, `querySelector()` returned the first DOM match regardless of visibility, causing CDP clicks on responsive pages to hit hidden mobile-layout elements at coordinates (0,0) instead of the visible desktop element. Falls back to first DOM match with a `console.warn` when all matches have zero dimensions
- **`evaluate()` now awaits async expressions**: Added `awaitPromise: true` to the `Runtime.evaluate` CDP call. Previously, async expressions (fetch, async IIFEs) returned the Promise object as `undefined` or `[object Object]` instead of the resolved value. `evaluateJson()` already had this — now `evaluate()` does too
- **`tabs.filter is not a function` crash**: `resolveWsUrl()` and `closeTab()` now check `Array.isArray()` before calling `.filter()`/`.find()` on `chromeHttp('/json')` results. When Chrome returns a non-array response (empty object, error), this previously crashed. `getTabs()` already had this guard (#27)

### Added
- **Test suite**: First project-level tests using Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`) with jsdom for DOM simulation. Covers element visibility selection, async evaluate behavior, and array guards on CDP responses

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-10 - Custom Chrome launch flags via `CHROME_EXTRA_ARGS`

### Added
- **`CHROME_EXTRA_ARGS` env var**: whitespace-separated Chrome launch flags that are appended to the hardcoded flag list in `startChrome()`. Unblocks containerized/headless setups that need to inject flags like `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader-webgl --enable-unsafe-swiftshader` for software WebGL (SwiftShader) when no GPU is present. Opt-in: unset = no behavior change (#32)
- **`buildChromeArgs()`** exported from `chrome-ws-lib` — pure function that assembles the Chrome launch flag list, enabling unit tests and external reuse

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-09 - CDP Mouse Actions, Human-Like Typing, and File Upload

### Added
- **`hover`**: Move mouse over element via CDP `mouseMoved`. Triggers CSS `:hover`, `mouseenter`/`mouseover` events, tooltips, dropdown menus
- **`drag_drop`**: Native drag-and-drop via CDP mouse event sequence (`mousePressed` → interpolated `mouseMoved` steps → `mouseReleased`). Fixes the browser restriction where synthetic `DragEvent` objects have neutered `DataTransfer`. Supports selector-to-selector and selector-to-coordinate targets
- **`mouse_move`**: Raw coordinate mouse movement with optional smooth interpolation. Useful for pre-click mouse patterns (bot detection) and captcha puzzles
- **`scroll`**: Mouse wheel scrolling via CDP `mouseWheel`. Accepts direction strings (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`) or JSON `{"deltaX":N,"deltaY":N}`. Simulates real wheel input vs `scrollTo()` which bot detectors flag
- **`double_click`**: Double-click with `clickCount:2`, fires `dblclick` event
- **`right_click`**: Right-click with `button:'right'`, fires `contextmenu` event
- **`human_type`**: Character-by-character text entry with realistic inter-key timing (~80-160ms per character). In headed mode, fires full `keyDown`/`keyUp` event chain per character with Shift handling for uppercase and symbols. In headless mode, uses `insertText` per character (headless Chrome intercepts `rawKeyDown` as browser shortcuts). **Recommended as the default text entry method** — `type` is now for speed-over-realism cases
- **`file_upload`**: Set files on `input[type=file]` elements via `DOM.setFileInputFiles`. The only way to programmatically upload files (JavaScript security restrictions prevent it)

### Changed
- Tool description now recommends `human_type` over `type` for text entry
- Help text lists `human_type` as PREFERRED in main interaction section
- Essential patterns (login flow) updated to use `human_type` + `keyboard_press Enter`
- Browsing skill (SKILL.md) fully updated with all new actions, examples, and patterns

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-25 - Viewport Emulation, Full-Page Screenshots, and HiDPI Fix

### Added
- **Viewport emulation** (`set_viewport`): device emulation with custom width/height/deviceScaleFactor and mobile mode (touch events + mobile UA string). Useful for responsive design testing and mobile screenshots
- **`clear_viewport`**: reset device emulation to browser default
- **`get_viewport`**: query current CSS viewport dimensions and devicePixelRatio
- **`clear_cookies`**: clear all browser cookies via CDP `Network.clearBrowserCookies`, without switching profiles
- **Full-page screenshots** (`fullpage: true`): capture entire scrollable page content beyond the visible viewport using `captureBeyondViewport` and `Page.getLayoutMetrics`. Available in MCP (`{"action": "screenshot", "payload": "full.png", "fullpage": true}`), CLI (`chrome-ws screenshot 0 full.png --fullpage`), and lib
- **`chrome-ws pid`** command: prints Chrome PID for X11 window management (e.g. `xdotool search --pid`)
- **`chrome-ws info`** command: prints JSON with pid, port, mode, profile, profileDir, and running status; reads meta.json so it works across processes
- **`getChromePid()`** exported from chrome-ws-lib
- **`browser_mode` action** now includes `pid` field

### Fixed
- **HiDPI screenshot sizing on Linux**: Viewport screenshots (no selector) now pass an explicit clip using `window.innerWidth`/`window.innerHeight` with `scale: 1` instead of relying on Chrome's internal DPI-scaled dimensions. All screenshots also pass `fromSurface: true`. Fixes oversized screenshots on Linux displays with system DPI scaling (e.g. 1.5x/Xft.dpi:144)

### Security
- **profileName path traversal**: `setProfileName()` now validates the profile name against `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` before writing meta.json, preventing path traversal via user-supplied profile names

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-08 - Dynamic Port Allocation and Multi-Instance Support

### Added
- **Dynamic CDP port allocation**: Chrome no longer hardcodes port 9222. `startChrome()` finds an available port in range 9222-12111, enabling multiple parallel Chrome instances without conflicts
- **Per-profile meta.json**: Port assignment, PID, and headless mode are persisted at `~/.cache/superpowers/browser-profiles/{name}.meta.json`. This enables:
  - Reconnection to Chrome instances that survive MCP restarts
  - Collision detection when port is already in use
  - Other sessions discovering which port a profile's Chrome is on
- **`--port=N` flag**: Both MCP server and CLI accept explicit port override
  - MCP: `node mcp/dist/index.js --port=9444`
  - CLI: `./chrome-ws start --port=9555`
- **`isPortAlive()` / `findAvailablePort()` utilities**: Exported from chrome-ws-lib for advanced use
- **`browser_mode` action**: Now returns `port` field alongside headless/headed status

### Changed
- **`startChrome()` signature**: New optional third parameter `port` for explicit port selection
- **Port priority**: explicit `--port` param > `CHROME_WS_PORT` env var > dynamic allocation
- **`showBrowser`/`hideBrowser`**: Now preserve the active port across Chrome restarts
- **`killChrome()`**: Clears meta.json so other sessions know the port is free

### Technical
- Added `chromeHttpAt(host, port, path, method)` for probing ports before setting `activePort`
- Module-level `activePort` variable replaces static `CHROME_DEBUG_PORT` in `chromeHttp()`
- `rewriteWsUrl` calls pass `activePort` for correct WebSocket URL rewriting
- Stale meta.json detected via PID liveness check (`process.kill(pid, 0)`) and Chrome `/json/version` probe

---

## [1.6.4] - 2026-01-31 - Clarify Auto-Capture in Tool Description and Skill

### Changed
- **MCP tool description**: Rewritten to clearly describe what each auto-captured file contains (viewport screenshot, structured markdown, full DOM, console messages) and guide Claude to prefer reading them over using extract or screenshot actions
- **MCP help text**: Aligned auto-capture section with new tool description language
- **Browsing skill**: Added Auto-Capture section explaining the capture system; updated screenshot action to indicate viewport screenshots are already auto-captured

---

## [1.6.3] - 2026-01-28 - Bug Fixes and Auto-Downscale Screenshots

### Fixed
- **Enter key form submission**: Added `text: '\r'` to Enter keyDown events, enabling native form submission via `\n` in type payloads
- **XPath text() selector on mixed content**: XPath selectors like `//a[text()='Settings']` now fallback to `normalize-space()` for elements with mixed content (e.g., `<a><svg/>Settings</a>`)
- **README Quick Start path**: Updated plugin installation path to include marketplace/version structure

### Added
- **Auto-downscale screenshots**: Screenshots exceeding 1800px are automatically downscaled using native tools (sips on macOS, ImageMagick on Linux) to prevent Claude API "2000px limit" errors in many-image mode
- **Eval patterns in skill docs**: Added documented patterns for viewport resize, cookie clearing, and scrolling via `eval` action
- **Test harness**: Added `test-harness.js` for automated React input testing (50+ iterations)

### Changed
- **Tab and Space keys**: Added `text` property to Tab (`\t`) and Space (` `) key definitions for consistency

---

## [1.6.2] - 2025-12-21 - Focus Preservation and Tab Navigation

### Fixed
- **Tab/Enter not working in type payloads**: Fixed `\t` and `\n` escape sequences in MCP payloads
  - MCP payloads contain literal backslash-t/n strings, not actual tab/newline characters
  - Added preprocessing to convert `\t` → tab and `\n` → newline before parsing
  - Now `type(selector, "field1\tfield2\n")` correctly tabs between fields and submits
- **Focus lost during screenshots**: Screenshots were stealing focus, breaking Tab navigation
  - Added `saveFocus()` and `restoreFocus()` helpers to `captureActionWithDiff()`
  - Saves focused element (by id, name, or DOM path) before screenshot
  - Restores focus after screenshot so subsequent actions work correctly
- **Type with selector losing focus**: Changed `fill()` to use `el.focus()` instead of `click()`
  - Click triggers `capturePageArtifacts()` which takes a screenshot, losing focus
  - Using JS focus avoids the capture side effect

### Technical
- `fill()` now preprocesses value with `.replace(/\\t/g, '\t').replace(/\\n/g, '\n')`
- `captureActionWithDiff()` wraps before-screenshot with focus save/restore
- Focus identification uses id > name > DOM path fallback strategy

---

## [1.6.1] - 2025-12-15 - Auto-Detect Headless Mode in Containers

### Fixed
- **Chrome crashes in containers**: MCP server now auto-detects display availability
  - Linux: Checks `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` environment variables
  - macOS: Checks `TERM_PROGRAM` or `DISPLAY`
  - Windows: Assumes display available (headless servers rare)
  - Falls back to headless mode when no display detected
- **Command-line overrides**: Added `--headed` flag to complement existing `--headless`
  - `--headless`: Force headless mode
  - `--headed`: Force headed mode (will fail if no display)
  - No flag: Auto-detect based on environment
- **Improved logging**: Startup message now shows mode and why it was chosen
  - Example: `(headless mode, auto-detected no display)`

### Technical
- Added `hasDisplay()` function for cross-platform display detection
- Previously Chrome defaulted to headed mode unless `--headless` was passed, causing crashes in containers/CI

---

## [1.6.0] - 2025-12-05 - XDG Cache, Browser Agent, and Profile Management

### Added
- **Persistent Chrome profiles with "superpowers-chrome" default**: Browser data now persists across sessions
  - Default profile: `superpowers-chrome`
  - Profile storage: `~/.cache/superpowers/browser-profiles/{profile-name}/`
  - Persists cookies, localStorage, extensions, auth sessions
  - Profile management actions: `set_profile`, `get_profile`
  - Optional profile parameter to `startChrome(headless, profileName)`
  - Agent-specific profiles enable isolated browser states
- **Headless mode by default**: Chrome now starts in headless mode for better performance and less desktop clutter
  - Screenshots work perfectly in headless mode
  - Faster startup and lower resource usage
  - No browser windows cluttering the desktop
- **Browser mode toggle**: New actions to control headless/headed mode
  - `show_browser`: Switch to headed mode (visible browser window)
  - `hide_browser`: Switch to headless mode (invisible browser)
  - `browser_mode`: Check current mode status and active profile
  - ⚠️ **WARNING**: Toggling modes restarts Chrome and reloads pages via GET (loses POST state)
- **XDG cache directory**: Session files now stored in platform-appropriate cache locations
  - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/superpowers/browser/YYYY-MM-DD/session-{timestamp}/`
  - Linux: `~/.cache/superpowers/browser/YYYY-MM-DD/session-{timestamp}/`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/superpowers/browser/YYYY-MM-DD/session-{timestamp}/`
  - Respects `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable on Linux
  - Date-based organization for easier cleanup
- **browser-user agent**: New read-only agent for browser automation tasks
  - Pre-loaded with browsing skill
  - Restricted to read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Skill, use_browser)
  - Cannot modify files or execute shell commands
  - Has access to browser cache directory for viewing captured pages

### Changed
- Chrome now defaults to headless mode instead of headed mode
- Chrome profiles now persist in XDG cache directory instead of temp directory
- Session directory structure uses XDG cache conventions
- Browser process management improved with proper PID tracking and graceful shutdown
- `browser_mode` action now returns profile information

### Fixed
- **set_profile action**: Fixed bug where `ensureChromeRunning()` prevented profile changes by exempting profile/info actions from auto-start

### Technical
- Added `chromeProcess`, `chromeHeadless`, `chromeUserDataDir`, `chromeProfileName` state tracking
- Implemented `killChrome()`, `showBrowser()`, `hideBrowser()`, `getBrowserMode()` functions
- Implemented `getChromeProfileDir()`, `getProfileName()`, `setProfileName()` for profile management
- `startChrome()` now accepts optional `profileName` parameter
- Export `getXdgCacheHome()` and `getChromeProfileDir()` for external use
- MCP server updated with five new actions: browser mode control + profile management
- Help text updated with browser mode and profile management documentation
- Comprehensive test suites:
  - `test-headless-toggle.cjs` - Validates headless mode switching
  - `test-profiles.cjs` - Validates profile isolation and persistence

---

## [1.5.4] - 2025-11-30 - Screenshot Returns Absolute Path

### Fixed
- **Screenshot path confusion**: `screenshot` action now returns absolute path instead of relative filename
  - Before: `Screenshot saved to solar_optimum.png` (Claude can't find it)
  - After: `Screenshot saved to /Users/jesse/project/solar_optimum.png` (Claude reads it directly)

---

## [1.5.3] - 2025-11-30 - Image Visibility and Single-Directory Auth

### Fixed
- **Image content visibility**: Markdown extraction now includes images with alt text and dimensions
  - Adds prominent notice: "📷 This page contains N significant image(s). Check screenshot.png for visual content."
  - Lists each image with description and size info
  - Handles `<figure>` elements with captions
- **Directory auth spam**: All capture files now go in single session directory
  - Changed from subdirectories (`001-navigate-timestamp/page.md`) to flat structure (`001-navigate.md`)
  - Only one directory permission prompt per session instead of per-page
  - Files use prefixes: `001-navigate.html`, `001-navigate.md`, `001-navigate.png`, `001-navigate-console.txt`

### Changed
- `createCaptureDir()` renamed to `createCapturePrefix()` - returns prefix string instead of creating subdirectory
- Response format updated to show flat file structure with prefixes
- Help text updated to reflect new file naming convention

---

## [1.5.2] - 2025-11-22 - Critical Fix: Restore Auto-Capture Functionality

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Restored all auto-capture and session management functionality that was accidentally removed
  - `initializeSession()`, `cleanupSession()`, `createCaptureDir()` - Session lifecycle management
  - `clickWithCapture()`, `fillWithCapture()`, `selectOptionWithCapture()`, `evaluateWithCapture()` - Auto-capture DOM actions
  - `enableConsoleLogging()`, `getConsoleMessages()`, `clearConsoleMessages()` - Console logging utilities
  - `generateDomSummary()`, `getPageSize()`, `generateMarkdown()`, `capturePageArtifacts()` - Capture utilities
  - Session-based directory structure and time-ordered capture subdirectories
  - 4-file capture format (page.html, page.md, screenshot.png, console-log.txt)
  - Smart DOM summary system
- **MCP server**: Now starts correctly without `initializeSession is not a function` error
- **Build system**: Rebuilt bundle with all restored functionality

### Changed
- **Windows compatibility**: Maintained host-override improvements from v1.5.0-1.5.1
  - `CHROME_DEBUG_HOST`, `CHROME_DEBUG_PORT`, `rewriteWsUrl()` integration preserved
  - Enhanced `getTabs()` and `newTab()` with WebSocket URL rewriting
  - Improved error handling for array responses

### Technical Details
The v1.5.0-1.5.1 Windows support work accidentally removed ~466 lines of auto-capture code from `chrome-ws-lib.js` that was added in v1.4.0. This release restores all v1.4.0 functionality while preserving the Windows host-override improvements.

---

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-02 - Session-Based Auto-Capture Enhancement

### Added

#### Session Management System
- **Session-based directory structure**: `/tmp/chrome-session-{timestamp}/`
  - Time-ordered capture subdirectories: `001-navigate-{timestamp}/`, `002-click-{timestamp}/`, etc.
  - Automatic cleanup on MCP exit (SIGINT, SIGTERM, normal exit)
  - Session initialization on first MCP use with `initializeSession()`
  - Global session tracking with `sessionDir` and `captureCounter` variables

#### Auto-Capture for DOM Actions
- **Navigate action enhancement**: Added `autoCapture` parameter (enabled by default in MCP)
- **New capture-enabled action functions**:
  - `clickWithCapture(tabIndex, selector)` - Click + immediate page capture
  - `fillWithCapture(tabIndex, selector, value)` - Type + post-type state capture
  - `selectOptionWithCapture(tabIndex, selector, value)` - Select + result capture
  - `evaluateWithCapture(tabIndex, expression)` - JavaScript eval + state capture

#### Standardized Capture Resources
- **4-file capture format per action**:
  - `page.html` - Full rendered DOM using `document.documentElement.outerHTML`
  - `page.md` - Structured markdown extraction from page elements
  - `screenshot.png` - Visual page state (renamed from `page.png`)
  - `console-log.txt` - Console message placeholder file

#### Smart DOM Summary System
- **Token-efficient DOM analysis** (replaces verbose hierarchical approach)
- **Interactive element counting**: Buttons, inputs, links with readable formatting
- **Structural analysis**: Navigation, main content areas, forms detection
- **Heading extraction**: First 3 H1 elements with truncation indicators
- **Bounded output**: <25 tokens regardless of page complexity

#### Console Logging Infrastructure
- **Console message storage**: Per-tab message tracking with `consoleMessages` Map
- **Runtime domain integration**: Console API event capture during navigation
- **Utility functions**: `enableConsoleLogging()`, `getConsoleMessages()`, `clearConsoleMessages()`
- **Placeholder implementation**: Framework ready for full console capture

#### Self-Contained Documentation

- **Auto-detection**: Headless mode logged in server startup message
- **CI/CD ready**: Perfect for automated testing and server deployments

### Changed

#### MCP Response Format Overhaul
- **Navigate responses**: Enhanced object return vs simple string
  ```
  → https://example.com (capture #001)
  Size: 1200×765
  Snapshot: /tmp/chrome-session-123/001-navigate-456/
  Resources: page.html, page.md, screenshot.png, console-log.txt
  DOM:
    Example Domain
    Interactive: 0 buttons, 0 inputs, 1 links
    Headings: "Example Domain"
    Layout: body
  ```

- **DOM action responses**: All now return detailed capture information
  - Click: `"Clicked: selector"` → Rich capture response
  - Type: `"Typed into: selector"` → Rich capture response with typed value
  - Select: `"Selected: value"` → Rich capture response with selection details
  - Eval: `"[result]"` → Rich capture response with expression and result

#### Internal Function Modifications
- **navigate() function**: Added `autoCapture` parameter and enhanced return object
- **Action routing in MCP**: All DOM actions now use `*WithCapture` variants
- **Response formatting**: New `formatActionResponse()` function for consistent output
- **File naming**: Standardized resource names across all captures

#### DOM Summary Algorithm
- **Replaced hierarchical DOM tree** with smart statistical summary
- **Element counting approach**: `document.querySelectorAll()` for precise counts
- **Layout detection**: Semantic element identification (nav, main, forms)
- **Text formatting improvements**: Quoted headings, readable spacing, truncation indicators

#### Documentation and User Experience
- **Auto-capture clarity**: Updated help to emphasize files are automatically saved

- **Progressive disclosure**: Added collapsible test automation section to skill
- **Troubleshooting**: Enhanced with JSON.stringify patterns and chrome-ws reference guidance

### Technical Implementation Details

#### File Structure Changes
```
skills/browsing/chrome-ws-lib.js:
  + Session management functions (initializeSession, cleanupSession, createCaptureDir)
  + Console logging utilities (enableConsoleLogging, getConsoleMessages, clearConsoleMessages)
  + Enhanced DOM functions (generateDomSummary, getPageSize, generateMarkdown, capturePageArtifacts)
  + Capture-enabled action wrappers (clickWithCapture, fillWithCapture, selectOptionWithCapture, evaluateWithCapture)
  * Modified navigate() function with autoCapture parameter

mcp/src/index.ts:
  + formatActionResponse() function for consistent response formatting
  + Enhanced navigate action with rich response handling
  * Modified click, type, select, eval actions to use capture variants
  + Session initialization in main() function
```

#### Process Lifecycle Integration
- **Cleanup handlers**: Registered for `exit`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM` events
- **Session persistence**: Directory maintained throughout MCP lifetime
- **Capture sequencing**: Incremental numbering for temporal ordering
- **Error recovery**: Auto-capture failures don't prevent action success

#### Browser Integration Enhancements
- **Dual domain enablement**: Page + Runtime domains for navigation with auto-capture
- **Message handling**: Enhanced WebSocket message processing for console events
- **Timing coordination**: 1-second delay after page load for console message capture
- **Parallel processing**: Simultaneous HTML, markdown, screenshot, and DOM summary generation

### Backward Compatibility
- **Original functions preserved**: `click()`, `fill()`, `selectOption()`, `evaluate()` unchanged
- **MCP tool interface**: No changes to external tool parameters or descriptions
- **Graceful degradation**: Auto-capture failures return basic success responses
- **Module exports**: All existing exports maintained, new functions added

### Performance Optimizations
- **Token efficiency**: 95% reduction in DOM summary token usage
- **Parallel capture**: Simultaneous file generation for faster response times
- **Memory management**: Session cleanup prevents directory accumulation
- **Bounded operations**: DOM summary algorithm has fixed computational complexity

### Benefits for Claude
- **Rich context**: Comprehensive page state after every DOM-changing action
- **Visual debugging**: Screenshots show immediate action results
- **Structured analysis**: Markdown format enables content analysis
- **Temporal tracking**: Numbered captures show interaction progression
- **Token preservation**: Smart DOM summary prevents large page token explosion
- **Organized workflow**: Session-based storage for complex automation sequences

- Improved tool clarity with examples
- Auto-tab creation when none exist

### Changed
- Enhanced payload parameter documentation with action-specific details
- Improved error handling for out-of-range tab indices

### Fixed
