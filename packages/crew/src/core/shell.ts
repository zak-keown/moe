/**
 * Shell-quoting utilities. Two functions with INTENTIONALLY DIFFERENT semantics:
 *
 *   shellQuote        – safe tokens pass through unquoted (for human-readable
 *                       reproduce lines where readability matters).
 *   shellQuoteAlways  – always wraps in single quotes (for args baked into a
 *                       string another shell will re-evaluate, e.g. a hook command
 *                       stored in a config file — a fast path would be unsafe there
 *                       because the outer string is later re-parsed by a shell).
 *
 * Keep both exported here so a future consolidation attempt is blocked by the
 * tests in test/shell.test.ts, which pin the behavioral difference.

 * unquoted; anything else is wrapped in single quotes (with embedded single

 * byte parity with %q.
 *
 * Safe for: terminal output, log messages, reproduce lines.
 * NOT safe for: baking into a string another shell will re-evaluate (use
 * `shellQuoteAlways` there — `=` and other chars can survive unquoted in the
 * current shell but break when re-parsed in a sub-shell context).
