/**
 * Codex launch-time tmux dances. Parity port of the bash codex driver's
 * `harness_post_launch` + `harness_await_ready` (drivers/codex.sh).
 *
 * These live in the command layer (not the HarnessDriver) because they need
 * `ctx.tmux` (capture/sendText/sendEnter) — context the driver's
 * `postLaunch(tmuxName)` / `awaitReady(tmuxName, sessionId)` slots do not
 * receive. The launch command calls them on the derive (codex) path, mirroring
 * how `awaitSessionStart` owns claude's proof-of-life wait.
 *
 * Both are best-effort: a worker that never shows the gate / composer still
 * "launches" (codex's `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` can race the gate, and
 * codex emits no session_start until the first prompt, so there is no hard
 * proof-of-life signal at launch — the meta self-registers on the first send).
