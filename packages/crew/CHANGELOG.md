# Changelog

## [4.0.0] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Rewrote `csd` from bash to a TypeScript core. The published plugin now ships
  committed `dist/` bundles (`dist/csd.cjs`, `dist/emit-event.cjs`,
  `dist/pi-extension.mjs`); there is **no build step for users** — the
  `skills/driving-claude-code-sessions/scripts/csd` shim just execs
  `node dist/csd.cjs`. The full v3.0.2 Claude command surface is preserved
  (`launch`/`adopt`/`list`/`grant-consent` and the per-worker
  `converse`/`send`/`wait-for-turn`/`status`/`read-events`/`read-turn`/`stop`/`handoff`/`session-id`/`events-file`).
- The lifecycle hooks are now **node programs** (`dist/emit-event.cjs`) instead
  of bash + `jq`. This resolves **issue #15** (on Windows, Claude Code's hook
  PATH did not include `bash`/`jq`, so the old shell hooks silently failed): node
  is inherently cross-platform, so the `run-hook.cmd` polyglot wrapper and the
  bash `emit-event`/`_lib.sh` are gone. `node` is the only added runtime
  dependency, and it ships wherever Claude Code runs.
- **`jq` is no longer a dependency.** The only external requirements are now
  `tmux` and the harness CLI you launch.
- The worker dir moved from `/tmp/claude-workers` to `/tmp/csd-workers`. When the
  default dir is in use, `csd` creates a back-compat symlink
  `/tmp/claude-workers → /tmp/csd-workers`, so existing references and shim paths
  keep resolving. Override the dir with `CSD_WORKER_DIR`.

### Added
- **Multi-harness support via `--harness <claude|codex|pi>`** on `csd launch`
  (default `claude`). The tool now drives three coding-agent harnesses — Claude
  Code, OpenAI Codex, and Pi — through the same CLI/tmux/command surface. The
  controller-facing commands behave identically across harnesses; only `adopt`
  is Claude-only (Codex and Pi mint their own session ids and offer no
  resume-by-id). Codex's control plane is the same node hooks as Claude (it
  stages the operator's `~/.codex` auth into a per-worker `CODEX_HOME`); Pi's is
  a native TypeScript extension loaded with `pi -e` (it stages `~/.pi/agent`).
- `CSD_CODEX_BIN` / `CSD_PI_BIN` — path to the codex / pi binary (mirrors
  `CSD_CLAUDE_BIN`; defaults resolved via `PATH`).
- `CSD_CODEX_MODEL` / `CSD_PI_MODEL` — optional model override for codex / pi
  workers (unset = the harness default; codex's is `gpt-5.5`).
- `csd prune` — sweep dead worker state in one pass: every registered worker
  whose tmux session is `gone` (the bulk equivalent of `stop`), plus meta-less
  leftover sidecars/shims whose tmux session is also gone (orphans from workers
  that bypassed `stop`, invisible to `list`). Live workers — including derive
  workers still in their pre-registration window — are left alone.
- `csd list` gains a `HARNESS` column and emits an `unregistered` row for each
  derive worker (codex/pi) that has launched but not yet minted its session id
  (live tmux + `.harness` sidecar, no meta). Prints `No workers found` when
  nothing matches instead of a bare header.
- `csd read-events --last N` works under `--follow` too: it caps the replayed
  backlog to the last N matching events before streaming new ones (`--last 0`
  skips the backlog entirely and follows only new events).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- Workers no longer fall back to the wrong model provider (e.g. an expired
  Bedrock token → first-turn 403) when a stale `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` (or
  other `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*`) sits in the tmux server's global environment, and
  workers under a host-brokered controller (cmux, IDE extensions) now keep their
  host-managed auth instead of being severed from it (#18). `csd` now pins the
  worker's provider/auth environment by clearing stale values without forcing
  new ones: it always clears `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT` (IDE-only) and, for
  `CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST` and the `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*` provider
  selectors, pins each empty only when it's absent from the controller's own
  environment (killing a stale tmux-global value), otherwise leaving it to
  inherit alongside its credentials. See
  `docs/reference/claude-code-provider-auth-env.md`.

### Added
- `csd adopt <tmux-name> <cwd> <session-id> [-- claude-args...]` — re-adopt an
  existing Claude session as a driveable worker via `claude --resume`. Restores
  a worker after a reboot/crash wiped `/tmp/claude-workers` while the session
  transcript survived under `~/.claude/projects`. Pre-writes the meta keyed by
  the (resume-preserved) session id so the worker emits events normally, then
  writes the standard shim. If a tmux session of that name already exists (e.g.
  restored by tmux-resurrect/continuum) it respawns the pane in place to
  preserve the restored layout; otherwise it opens a new one.
- `examples/recover-workers.sh` — bulk recovery built on `csd adopt`: derives
  each worker's session id from a tmux-resurrect snapshot (or live tmux) and the
  `~/.claude/projects` transcripts, with `--dry-run`, `--manifest` pins for
  cwd-shared sessions, and `--pattern` filtering.

### Internal
- Extracted `_await_session_start` and `_write_worker_shim` helpers shared by
  `cmd_launch` and `cmd_adopt` (no behavior change to `launch`).

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- `csd send` could paste a prompt without submitting it in slow or remote
  tmux sessions: the single Enter, sent after a fixed `sleep 0.1`, landed
  before Claude Code had converted the bracketed paste into its input
  widget and was swallowed, leaving the prompt pasted but unsubmitted
  (#20). `send` now confirms submission via the worker's
  `user_prompt_submit` event and re-sends Enter until that event appears,
  failing loudly instead of returning success if it never does.

### Added
- `CSD_SUBMIT_TIMEOUT` (default 10s) and `CSD_SUBMIT_RETRY_INTERVAL`
  (default 2s) tune how long `csd send` waits for submission confirmation
  and how often it re-sends Enter — raise them for slow remote sessions.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-18

### Breaking changes
- Replaced 12 per-operation scripts with a single `csd` CLI at
  `skills/driving-claude-code-sessions/scripts/csd`. The old scripts
  (`launch-worker.sh`, `converse.sh`, `send-prompt.sh`,
  `wait-for-event.sh`, `read-events.sh`, `read-turn.sh`, `status.sh`,
  `stop-worker.sh`, `handoff.sh`, `list-workers.sh`, `current.sh`,
  `grant-consent.sh`) are removed.
- `csd launch` writes a per-worker shim at
  `/tmp/claude-workers/bin/<tmux-name>` and prints that path on stdout.
  All per-worker operations go through the shim — see the rewritten
  SKILL.md for the new workflow.
- `wait-for-event` is replaced by `wait-for-turn`, which matches `stop`
  OR `session_end` (the only two events that signal "controller's
  turn"). Raw-event waits are no longer supported; use
  `$WORKER read-events --type T --follow` if you need ambient
  observation.
- `current` is removed — it returned "most-recently-touched meta file,"
  which silently misleads in multi-worker controllers. Use `csd list`.
- The meta file format gains `cwd` (was already present) and
  `invocation` (new) fields. Old workers from prior versions are not
  upgraded; relaunch them.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- Workers no longer hang when the worker (or a subagent it spawns via the
  `Agent` tool) calls `AskUserQuestion`. There is no human at a worker's
  terminal to answer the modal, so the dialog would render in the worker's
  tmux pane and block the turn forever — no `stop` event would fire, the
  controller's wait would time out, and the worker would be wedged.
  `launch-worker.sh` now passes `--disallowed-tools AskUserQuestion` to
  the worker's `claude` invocation, which takes the tool off the menu
  entirely and (verified) propagates to spawned subagents as well.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- **Dropped the controller-side tool-call approval gate.** Workers run with
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and execute tool calls without prompting;
  the plugin no longer pretends otherwise. Empirical testing confirmed that
  Claude Code ignores hook-returned `permissionDecision` values under that
  flag, so the previous `pre_tool_use` → poll-for-`tool-decision` →
  allow/deny dance was cosmetic. Removing the fake gate makes the threat
  model honest: a worker does whatever its prompt tells it to do, and the
  controller's job is to choose its prompts carefully and watch the event
  stream.
- The `PreToolUse` hook is now observation-only. It still emits a
  `pre_tool_use` event (with `tool` and `tool_input` fields) to the event
  stream so a controller can monitor what each worker is doing. The
  `approve-tool` hook is gone — `emit-event` handles every lifecycle hook.
- `scripts/grant-consent.sh` rewrites the consent screen to be accurate
  about what the plugin actually does: workers run in bypass mode, the
  hook is for observation, and there is no per-call gating. Existing
  consent files remain valid since the underlying threat model
  (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) hasn't changed.
- `scripts/status.sh` no longer returns `awaiting-approval`; the four
  remaining states are `idle | working | terminated | gone` (plus
  `unknown` when the events file hasn't been created yet).

### Removed
- `scripts/approve-tool.sh` — controller-side decision writer is no
  longer meaningful. **Breaking for anyone scripting against it.**
- `hooks/approve-tool` — replaced by `hooks/emit-event` handling
  `PreToolUse`.
- `CLAUDE_SESSION_DRIVER_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` env var — there's no decision
  to wait for, so the timeout has no purpose.
- `/tmp/claude-workers/<id>.tool-pending` and `.tool-decision` files no
  longer exist.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed
- **Scripts directory moved into the skill.** Per the
  [agent-skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification), bundled scripts
  belong in `<skill>/scripts/`. Helper scripts have moved from `scripts/`
  (plugin root) to `skills/driving-claude-code-sessions/scripts/`. The
  SKILL.md now uses bare relative paths (`scripts/launch-worker.sh`) and
  instructs the controller to prepend this skill's absolute base path when
  invoking via the Bash tool — matching the spec's "resolve relative paths
  against the skill's directory, use absolute paths in tool calls" rule.
  **Breaking for anyone scripting against the old `<plugin-root>/scripts/`
  path**; update references to point at the skill's scripts directory.
- **Every script accepts either `session_id` or `tmux_name`** as the worker
  handle. `wait-for-event.sh`, `read-events.sh`, `read-turn.sh`,
  `approve-tool.sh`, `converse.sh`, and `stop-worker.sh` all share a
  resolver (`scripts/_lib.sh`) that looks up whichever form wasn't passed
  via `/tmp/claude-workers/<id>.meta`. Cuts the bookkeeping a controller has
  to thread through call chains.

### Added
- `converse.sh --with-turn` returns the full markdown turn (tool calls,
  results, thinking, final text) via `read-turn.sh` instead of just the final
  assistant text. Useful when the worker is doing tool work and the bare
  text response strips out the interesting part.
- `list-workers.sh` shows alive workers by default; `--all` includes dead
  ones (meta files left behind after tmux session went away). Pruning dead
  workers is `stop-worker.sh <id>` on each — it cleans up files even when
  the tmux session is already gone.
- `current.sh` prints the session_id of the most recently launched worker —
  for one-worker flows where threading the UUID through every call is
  overhead.
- `status.sh <worker>` returns one of `idle | working | awaiting-approval
  | terminated | gone | unknown`. Use before sending a follow-up prompt to
  avoid racing the worker mid-thought when using `send-prompt.sh` +
  `wait-for-event.sh` directly rather than `converse.sh`.
- `handoff.sh <worker>` prints a ready-to-paste handoff message with the
  attach command, detach instructions, and a reminder not to stop the
  worker mid-handoff.

### Removed
- Legacy `<tmux-name> <session-id>` two-arg form for `converse.sh` and
  `stop-worker.sh`. With the resolver in place these are redundant; both now
  take a single worker handle (either form).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- **SUP-239**: send-prompt.sh now wraps prompt text in bracketed-paste
  markers (\x1B[200~ ... \x1B[201~) and inserts a 100ms gap before Enter,
  matching the pattern Anthropic's own SDK uses to drive a Claude Code TUI.
  Long prompts (30+ lines, unicode) no longer intermittently stick in the
  worker's input box without submitting.
- **#9**: emit-event and approve-tool hooks no longer hang indefinitely
  when stdin is never closed. Replaced unbounded `cat` with `read -t 5 -d ''`,
  exit-0 on empty input. approve-tool additionally emits an explicit deny
  decision on empty or unparseable stdin so a worker running with
  --dangerously-skip-permissions can't accidentally auto-approve tool calls
  when the hook payload is malformed.
- **#14, #15**: hooks/run-hook.cmd polyglot wrapper for cross-platform
  invocation. Quotes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to survive Windows paths with
  spaces and locates `bash.exe` via Git for Windows install paths so hooks
  run when Claude Code's hook PATH doesn't include bash. Hook scripts
  (emit-event, approve-tool) renamed to extensionless filenames so Windows
  auto-detection doesn't double-invoke them.
- **#11**: launch-worker.sh now works when invoked from inside another
  Claude session. Blanks the two env vars that break a nested worker
  (CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT, CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST) via
  `tmux -e VAR=`. Passes `--settings '{"skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt":true}'`
  to silence the bypass-permissions warning dialog. Content-aware accept
  of the workspace-trust dialog only when it actually appears, so other
  dialogs (onboarding, theme picker) surface in the timeout error with
  `tmux capture-pane` output instead of getting auto-dismissed. On
  wait-for-event timeout, dumps the worker pane to stderr so the user can
  see what's blocking.

### Added
- One-time consent flow for running workers with
  --dangerously-skip-permissions. A new `scripts/grant-consent.sh` walks
  the user through what the plugin does and records acceptance in
  `~/.claude/.claude-session-driver-consent`. launch-worker.sh refuses to
  spawn workers until the dotfile exists, pointing the user at
  grant-consent.sh in the error message. Existing users will need to run
  `bash scripts/grant-consent.sh` once after updating.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Hooks no longer fire in non-worker sessions. Previously, the PreToolUse
  hook polled for 30 seconds on every tool call even in normal interactive
  and --dangerously-skip-permissions sessions. Hooks now check for the .meta
  file created by launch-worker.sh and exit immediately when absent.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Initial release: launch, control, and monitor Claude Code worker sessions
  via tmux with lifecycle event hooks and controller-gated tool approval.
