/**
 * File-based exclusive locks. Thin wrapper around the `proper-lockfile`
 * package, which uses an atomic mkdir + mtime-heartbeat protocol that is
 * race-free under concurrent stale-stealers — the failure mode that pure
 * "openSync(wx) + PID file" implementations cannot fully close without
 * advisory locking (flock/fcntl).
 *
 * Used by long-running background work that must not run more than once at a
 * time on a given machine: the embedding migration (#73) and
 * `sync --background` (#97).
 *
 * On disk for a held lock at `<lockPath>`:
 *   <lockPath>             — diagnostic file containing the holder's PID
 *   <lockPath>.lock/       — proper-lockfile's mutex directory (mkdir-atomic)
 *
 * Stale recovery is mtime-based with a 10-minute threshold: if the holder
 * crashed without releasing, the .lock/ directory's mtime stops advancing,
 * and a contender past the threshold steals it atomically. The protocol's
 * atomicity guarantee is the package's contract — see proper-lockfile's
 * README for the underlying analysis (the same approach used by npm itself).
 *
 * Error policy:
 *   - `null` means lock contention.
 *   - Unexpected I/O errors (EACCES, ENOSPC, EMFILE, etc.) are thrown so
 *     callers can surface disk problems rather than mask them as "locked".
