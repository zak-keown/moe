/**
 * Embedding migration.
 *
 * The encoder was upgraded from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to bge-small-en-v1.5. Existing
 * databases have vec_exchanges rows produced by the old encoder. This module
 * provides the primitives for an incremental, lock-protected, resumable
 * background migration that re-embeds stale rows in batches during sync.
 *
 *   EMBEDDING_VERSION   — bumped any time the encoder pipeline changes
 *   acquire/release lock — file-based with PID-liveness fallback
 *   pickStaleBatch       — find rows whose embedding_version is behind
 *   recordReembedded     — atomic update of vec_exchanges + version bump
 *
 * This mechanism is the single strongest argument for building the merged
 * package on episodic-memory's foundation: private-journal-mcp had no version
 * stamp at all, and its startup scan keyed purely on the ABSENCE of a sidecar,
 * so it would never have re-embedded a stale one.
