 * Thin execFile wrapper that always resolves (never rejects).

 * On spawn failure (ENOENT etc.), resolves with code 1 and the error in stderr.
 * This lets callers branch on `code` just like checking `$?` in bash.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: execFile with an args array never invokes a shell, making
 * shell-quoting/injection bugs impossible by construction.
