/**
 * Payload normalization for the use_browser tool's `payload` parameter.
 *
 * `payload` is declared as `z.union([z.string(), z.record(z.any())])` —
 * every action accepts either a real object or a string. The string form
 * exists because MCP clients frequently JSON.stringify their arguments
 * regardless of the target action's shape (see e.g. the mouse_move example
 * in skills/browsing/SKILL.md, which passes
 * `payload: "{\"x\":100,\"y\":200}"`).
 *
 * Historically, a string payload was never JSON.parse'd — it was wrapped
 * literally as `{ [defaultKey]: <the raw string> }`. That's correct for
 * actions whose payload IS free text or code (eval's JS source, type's
 * literal text, await_text's search string — see PAYLOAD_SPECS below), but
 * wrong for actions whose payload is a multi-field object with no
 * legitimate bare-string meaning (set_viewport's {width,height},
 * mouse_move's {x,y}): a caller who JSON.stringify'd `{width:390,
 * height:844}` got back a payload of `{ viewport: '{"width":390,...}' }`,
 * `vp.width` was `undefined`, and the action threw "requires payload with
 * width and height" — even though both were supplied, just encoded as a
 * string instead of passed as an object.
 *
 * This module is the single place that decides, per action, whether a
 * string payload should be treated as encoded JSON to deserialize
 * ('structured') or taken literally as the value itself ('scalar' — code
 * or free text). It has no side effects and doesn't touch chrome-ws, so it
 * can be imported directly by tests without booting a browser or an MCP
 * server.

 * Per-action payload shape declaration — the source of truth Postel's-law

 *
 * kind: 'scalar' — the string IS the value. NEVER JSON.parse'd, no matter
 * how JSON-ish it looks. This is for code or free text where a payload of
 * `[1,2]` or `{"a":1}` is a perfectly normal *literal* value and silently
 * reinterpreting it would change what a currently-working call does:
 * eval (JS source), type (literal text to type), await_text (literal text
 * to wait for), select (a dropdown option's literal value/text).
 *
 * kind: 'structured' — the payload is semantically an object with named
 * fields. A string payload is JSON.parse'd; if it parses to a plain
 * object, that object *is* the payload (Postel's law: a stringified
 * encoding of the object form works the same as passing the object
 * directly). If it parses to an array, the array is wrapped under
 * defaultKey (file_upload's `files` may legitimately be a JSON array of
 * paths). If parsing fails, or produces something else, parsePayload()
 * falls back to the historical literal-wrap under defaultKey — most
 * 'structured' actions also have a legitimate single-value bare-string
 * form (navigate's URL, a CSS selector, an attribute/key/profile name, a
 * file path, a format keyword) so a non-JSON string must still work
 * exactly as it always has, not error out.
 *
 * Two actions — set_viewport and mouse_move — are 'structured' with NO
 * legitimate bare-string fallback at all (there's no sensible single
 * string that means "width and height" or "x and y"). Those two use
 * resolveStrictStructuredPayload() below instead of parsePayload(), so a
 * string that isn't parseable JSON produces an honest error instead of
 * being silently wrapped and then failing a field check with a misleading
 * "missing" message.
 *
 * scroll and drag_drop are NOT listed here: their bare-string form maps to
 * a *different* field than their object form's defaultKey would (scroll's
 * bare string is a direction keyword, not a deltaX/deltaY value; drag_drop's
 * bare string is the *target* selector, not the *source*), and drag_drop
 * additionally has a bare-coordinates form. A single generic
 * `{ [defaultKey]: string }` wrap can't express that, so they keep bespoke
 * dispatch in index.ts — but that dispatch uses the same tryParseJsonObject()
 * primitive defined below instead of ad hoc inline JSON.parse calls.

 *    name, a file path, ...) keeps working exactly as before.

 * The object and array decodes go through the same primitive that backs
 * tryParseJsonObject(), so there is one implementation of "maybe-JSON
 * string -> shape" rather than the two idioms this module used to carry.
 * The primitive is called with trimBeforeParse=false here, preserving this
 * path's historical raw-JSON.parse semantics: a JSON string prefixed with
 * something JSON.parse rejects but String.trim() removes (a BOM, a

 * between the two callers, and it is deliberate — collapsing it would
