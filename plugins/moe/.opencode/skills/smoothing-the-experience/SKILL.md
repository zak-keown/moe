# Smoothing the Experience

Run the skill-owned helper with Node. The audit is local, deterministic, on demand, and never a background service. It evaluates Claude Code and Codex on a best-effort basis. Report any other installed harness as `not evaluated`; do not imply that Moe audited it. In the steps below, `$SKILL` is the absolute path to `skills/smoothing-the-experience/scripts`.

1. Run `node "$SKILL/smooth.mjs" scan --days 30`.
2. Present Claude Code and Codex separately. Preserve `not evaluated`, `blocked`, and `no narrow renderer` dispositions.
3. Ask the user to select individual candidate IDs. Never offer select-all.
4. Run `node "$SKILL/smooth.mjs" plan --select <comma-separated-ids>` for exactly one harness and show the exact diff.
5. Explain the destination and whether a new session is required.
6. Do not run `apply` until the user explicitly confirms that exact diff, one harness at a time.
7. Pass the plan path and printed confirmation token to `node "$SKILL/smooth.mjs" apply --plan <path> --confirm <token>`. Report whether the change applied and whether the user must start a new session. Leave every other harness unchanged.

Never summarize raw transcripts, broaden a rule, reinterpret an ineligible item, or bypass a helper refusal.
