description: Use when a project has more than one plan and you need to know which is runnable next — reads a committed manifest, runs a Kahn topological ready-set, and dispatches one plan at a time. Do NOT use for intra-plan step order (that is `writing-plans` and `subagent-driven-development`) or for greenfield spec work (that is `iterative-development`).

# Sequencing Plans

## Overview

`writing-plans` produces one plan. `subagent-driven-development` (SDD) executes
one plan and ledgers its own tasks. Neither models the space above one plan.
This skill does — with one committed file per project, one CLI, and one loop.

Use it when brainstorming split a spec into more than one plan and each plan
depends on the previous one (or on a diamond of previous ones) landing. The
first version of this problem is deterministic and cheap. Nothing here holds
state across sessions except the manifest, and the manifest is a git-tracked
markdown file — a fresh session on another machine reads the same answer.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the sequencing-plans skill to run this plan
set."

## When NOT to use this

- **One plan.** `writing-plans` covers it. This skill exists for the
  cross-plan case.
- **Intra-plan step order.** SDD's per-task ledger already handles that inside
  one plan.
- **Greenfield spec work over a large surface.** `iterative-development` is
  the right cluster for that; its state model is per-iteration, and this skill
  will not help.
- **Parallel plan dispatch.** Not covered here (`parallel-execution-option`
  owns the write-ban lift). Run one plan at a time.

## The manifest

One file per project, committed alongside the plans it names:
`docs/moe/plans/<project>-MANIFEST.md`. It is a markdown wrapper around one
fenced YAML block. Fields:

- `id` — short label unique in this manifest. Used by `plan-set done` and by
  every `depends_on` reference. Recommend the plan slug.
- `plan` — path to the plan markdown, from the repository root.
- `depends_on` — list of ids that must be `done` before this plan is ready. `[]`
  when nothing precedes it.
- `status` — one of `pending`, `running`, `done`, `blocked`. New entries start
  as `pending`. `blocked` is terminal and propagates: every dependent of a
  `blocked` node is treated as blocked too, so a plan whose foundation stopped
  by design is never handed back as "ready".
- `commits` — set by `plan-set done`, not by hand. `<base7>..<head7>` for the
  range of commits the finished plan produced.

Example:

````markdown
# <Project> Plan Set

Prose describing the project. `plan-set` reads only the yaml block below.

```yaml
plans:
  - id: schema
    plan: docs/moe/plans/2026-01-01-schema.md
    depends_on: []
    status: pending
  - id: reader
    plan: docs/moe/plans/2026-01-02-reader.md
    depends_on: [schema]
    status: pending
  - id: writer
    plan: docs/moe/plans/2026-01-03-writer.md
    depends_on: [schema]
    status: pending
  - id: server
    plan: docs/moe/plans/2026-01-04-server.md
    depends_on: [reader, writer]
    status: pending
```
````

## The CLI

Resolve [skills/sequencing-plans/scripts/plan-set.mjs](scripts/plan-set.mjs) relative to this
loaded document. It is a plugin-owned Node launcher, not a global executable:
invoke the resolved resource with `node`, never as a bare `plan-set` command.
It locates the plugin's scheduler independently of the project working
directory and ships in the `moe` plugin alongside this skill.

Verbs:

- `plan-set next [--manifest <path>]` — Print every id whose dependencies are
  all `done` and whose own status is `pending`. One id per line. `blocked`
  nodes and their transitive dependents never appear.
- `plan-set done <id> <base>..<head> [--manifest <path>]` — Mark `<id>` as
  `done` and record its commit range. Fails if `<id>` is unknown, if any
  dependency of `<id>` is not `done`, or if the range is not two 7+-char hex
  SHAs joined by `..`.
- `plan-set check [--manifest <path>]` — Validate: unique ids, all plan files
  exist, all deps resolve, no cycle (Kahn), no plan path listed twice. Exits
  non-zero on any failure. A cycle names its nodes on stderr.

If `--manifest` is omitted, `plan-set` looks for exactly one file matching
`docs/moe/plans/*-MANIFEST.md` under the current directory. More than one is a
call the CLI refuses to guess.

## The SessionStart hook

`plan-set-notice` is a bash SessionStart hook that fires on `startup|clear|compact`.
It looks in the session's cwd for `docs/moe/plans/*-MANIFEST.md`, and if one
exists and has any runnable plans, it prints their ids and a `plan-set next`
command as SessionStart `additionalContext`. Fully deterministic — no model in
the loop. Every failure path exits 0; a broken notice must never break a session.

The hook exists so the cold-start case ("new session, four plans exist, which
are done?") is caught even when the transcript has no history and no skill
description is triggering. `plan-set-notice` announces; this skill carries the
loop.

## The loop

1. **Confirm the manifest.** Invoke the resolved `plan-set.mjs` resource as
   `node "<resolved-plan-set.mjs>" check --manifest docs/moe/plans/<project>-MANIFEST.md`
   before anything else. A cycle, a missing plan file, or a duplicate id is a
   dead end before the first plan runs, and `check` says which one at once.

2. **Pick the next plan.** Invoke it as
   `node "<resolved-plan-set.mjs>" next --manifest …`. `next`
   returns a set; v1 takes the first line of it.

   ```bash
   NEXT=$(node "<resolved-plan-set.mjs>" next \
     --manifest docs/moe/plans/foo-MANIFEST.md | head -n 1)
   ```

   If the output is empty, either everything is `done` (the project is
   finished) or everything ready is `blocked` (a foundation stopped by design
   and its dependents cannot run). Do not dispatch in either case.

3. **Dispatch.** Read the plan path for `$NEXT` out of the manifest and hand
   the plan off to `subagent-driven-development` (the recommended executor) or
   `executing-plans` (the no-subagents fallback). Both skills already own
   their own per-task ledger, so this skill does not track task-level state.

4. **Record completion.** When the plan finishes cleanly, capture the branch's
   base and head SHAs and mark it done:

   ```bash
   node "<resolved-plan-set.mjs>" done "$NEXT" \
     "$(git merge-base main HEAD | cut -c1-7)..$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
     --manifest docs/moe/plans/foo-MANIFEST.md
   ```

   `done` refuses to run if `$NEXT`'s dependencies are not all `done` — a
   safeguard against marking things done out of order.

5. **Loop.** Return to step 2.

## When to mark a plan `blocked`

`blocked` is terminal and propagates. Use it when a plan has stopped by
design — the spec changed, the approach is being reconsidered, an external
dependency is not going to land. Do NOT use it as a synonym for "in progress"
or "waiting for review": those are `running`.

The reason `blocked` matters is that its dependents are still `pending` in the
file. A naive "artifact exists = done" reader hands the agent a plan whose
foundation was never built. `plan-set next` never returns a dependent of a
`blocked` node.

Edit the manifest by hand to mark a plan `blocked`; there is no CLI verb for
it, on purpose — it is a decision, not a state transition.

## Design notes

- **`next` returns a set, not a single id.** v1 takes the first of it. The set
  is the seam a later cross-plan scheduler would read, once the parallel-write
  ban is lifted. Nothing here requires that ban lifted.
- **The CLI lives under `hooks/`, not this skill's directory.** Every other
  skill's scripts sit inside its own directory. Splitting them is a
  consequence of the tier filter (`scripts/mint-plugins.mjs` copies only the
  in-tier skills, but copies `hooks/` for every plugin), not a preference. If
  D2 is later reversed for this skill, the script should move into
  `skills/sequencing-plans/scripts/`.
- **`plan-set` is Node, not bash.** Kahn's algorithm plus per-line YAML
  parsing over a mutable file is short in JS and painful in bash. Node ships
  with every harness this fork targets.
- **The manifest is a markdown wrapper around one YAML block, not a bare YAML
  file.** The wrapper is where humans write the prose that says what the
  project is for. `plan-set` reads the yaml block and ignores everything
  outside it.
