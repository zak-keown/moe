# Developing Claude Code Plugins

## Overview

This skill provides efficient workflows for creating Claude Code plugins. Use it to make plugin development fast and correct - it synthesizes official docs into actionable steps and provides working examples.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new Claude Code plugin from scratch
- Adding components to an existing plugin (skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers)
- Setting up a development marketplace for testing
- Troubleshooting plugin structure issues
- Understanding plugin architecture and patterns
- Releasing a plugin (versioning, tagging, marketplace distribution)
- Publishing updates or maintaining existing plugins

**For comprehensive official documentation**, use native skill discovery to load `cc-config` for full docs.

## Plugin Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Plan

Before writing code:

1. **Define your plugin's purpose**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who will use it?
   - What components will it need?

2. **Choose your pattern** (read `references/common-patterns.md`)
   - Simple plugin with one skill?
   - MCP integration with guidance?
   - Command collection?
   - Full-featured platform?

3. **Review examples**
   - `examples/simple-greeter-plugin/` - Minimal plugin
   - `examples/full-featured-plugin/` - All components
   - Installed plugins in `~/.claude/plugins/`

### Phase 2: Create Structure

1. **Create directories** (see `references/plugin-structure.md` for details):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin
   mkdir -p my-plugin/skills
   # Add other component directories as needed
   ```

2. **Declare the plugin in `moe-mint.yaml`** — do NOT hand-write a manifest.

   In this repo, `@bubstack/moe-mint` generates `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and every other harness manifest from one
   config file. A hand-edited manifest is overwritten by the next `generate`
   and reported as drift by `moe-mint validate`.

   ```yaml
   name: my-plugin
   version: 1.0.0
   description: What your plugin does
   author:
     name: Your Name
   bootstrap: none        # or { skill: <name> } for a session-start skill
   ```

   Then:
   ```bash
   moe-mint generate
   ```

   `references/plugin-structure.md` documents the manifest shape mint emits.
   Read it to understand the output; do not author the output.

3. **Outside this repo**, where there is no mint, write
   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and a local `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   by hand in the shapes `references/plugin-structure.md` gives. Everything
   below applies either way.

### Phase 3: Add Components

Use maintain a task artifact with `write_to_file` and `replace_file_content` to log component creation:

**Example:**
```
- Create skill: main-workflow
- Add command: /hello
- Configure hooks
- Write README
- Test installation
```

For each component type, see:
- **Format/syntax**: `references/plugin-structure.md`
- **When to use**: `references/common-patterns.md`
- **Working code**: `examples/` directory

### Phase 4: Test Locally

1. **Install for testing**:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add /path/to/my-plugin
   /plugin install my-plugin@my-dev
   ```
   Then restart Claude Code.

2. **Test each component**:
   - Skills: Ask for tasks matching skill descriptions
   - Commands: Run `/your-command`
   - MCP servers: Check tools are available
   - Hooks: Trigger relevant events

3. **Iterate**:
   ```bash
   /plugin uninstall my-plugin@my-dev
   # Make changes
   /plugin install my-plugin@my-dev
   # Restart Claude Code
   ```

### Phase 5: Debug and Refine

If something doesn't work, read `references/troubleshooting.md` for:
- Plugin not loading
- Skill not triggering
- Command not appearing
- MCP server not starting
- Hooks not firing

Common issues are usually:
- Wrong directory structure
- Hardcoded paths (use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`)
- Forgot to restart Claude Code
- Missing executable permissions on scripts

### Phase 6: Release and Distribute

1. **Write README** with:
   - What the plugin does
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Component descriptions

2. **Bump the version** with the tool that owns it:
   ```bash
   moe-mint bump <new-version>      # rewrites moe-mint.yaml and regenerates
   moe-mint bump --audit            # finds stray copies of the old version
   ```
   Semantic versioning, `major.minor.patch`. Record what changed in the
   package's own notes — never in an upstream `CHANGELOG.md` or
   `RELEASE-NOTES.md`, which are inherited record and are not ours to edit.

3. **Commit to a branch and open a merge request.** Do not push to the
   default branch and do not tag a release: CI runs from one root
   `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and there is no release workflow to trigger.

4. **Distribution — one path only.**

   Moe publishes nothing publicly (ARCHITECTURE.md section 8, decided
   2026-08-31). No crates.io, no PyPI, no npm, no public GitHub marketplace.
   A plugin ships by being listed in this repo's single root
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, which points at the generated tree under
   `/plugins/<name>`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "moe",
     "plugins": [{
       "name": "my-plugin",
       "source": "./plugins/my-plugin",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "description": "What your plugin does",
       "strict": true
     }]
   }
   ```

   Teammates install from a clone:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add /path/to/moe
   /plugin install my-plugin@moe
   ```

   Anything that genuinely must be consumable outside the repo goes to the
   GitLab instance registry under the `@bubstack` scope. Nothing else leaves
   the company.

5. **Test the install** from a clean checkout:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add /path/to/moe
   /plugin install my-plugin@moe
   # verify each component, then
   /plugin uninstall my-plugin@moe
   ```

6. **Announce and maintain**: tell the team, watch for issues, plan the next
   change. There are no public release notes to write.

## Critical Rules

**Always follow these** (from `references/plugin-structure.md`):

1. **`.claude-plugin/` contains ONLY manifests** (`plugin.json` and optionally `marketplace.json`)
   - ❌ Don't put skills, commands, or other components inside
   - ✅ Put them at plugin root

2. **Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for all paths in config files**
   - Makes plugin portable across systems
   - Required for hooks, MCP servers, scripts

3. **Use relative paths in `plugin.json`**
   - Start with `./`
   - Relative to plugin root

4. **Make scripts executable**
   - `chmod +x script.sh`
   - Required for hooks and MCP servers

## Cross-References

For deep dives into official documentation, use the `cc-config` skill to access:
- `plugins.md` - Plugin development overview
- `plugins-reference.md` - Complete API reference
- `skills.md` - Skill authoring guide
- `slash-commands.md` - Command format
- `hooks.md`, `hooks-guide.md` - Hook system
- `mcp.md` - MCP server integration
- `plugin-marketplaces.md` - Distribution

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** - Begin with minimal structure, add complexity when needed
2. **Test frequently** - Install → test → uninstall → modify → repeat
3. **Use examples** - Copy patterns from working plugins
4. **Follow conventions** - Match style of existing plugins
5. **Document everything** - Clear README helps users and future you
6. **Version properly** - Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)

## Workflow Summary

```
Plan → Choose pattern, review examples
Create → Make structure, write manifests
Add → Build components (skills, commands, etc.)
Test → Install via dev marketplace
Debug → Use troubleshooting guide
Release → Version, tag, distribute via marketplace
Maintain → Monitor, update, support users
```

**The correct path is the fast path.** Use references, follow patterns, test frequently.
